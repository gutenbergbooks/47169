<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The greater part of the materials for this volume
were collected during a long official residence in the
country to which they relate: containing, as I believe
they do, some information which may be interesting,
if not useful, I feel that I ought not to withhold them
from the public, in whose service they were obtained.</p>

<p>The chapters which give an account of the settlements
made by the old Spaniards on the coast of
Patagonia, and of the explorations of the Pampas south
of Buenos Ayres, both by them and their successors
in the present century, will be found to throw some
new light on the progress of geographical discovery
in that part of the world. Our occupation of the
Falkland Islands, in the first instance, and the work
shortly afterwards published by Falkner in this country,
pointing out the defenceless state of Patagonia,
joined to the enterprising character of the British
voyages of discovery about the same period, appears
to have stimulated the Spaniards, in alarm lest we
should forestall them, to examine their coasts, to
explore their rivers, and to found settlements, of
which every record was concealed from public view,
lest the world at large should become better ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>quainted
with possessions, all knowledge of which
it was their particular care and policy to endeavour
to keep to themselves.</p>

<p>Thus, though Spain, at an enormous cost, acquired
some better information relative to countries over
which she claimed a nominal sovereignty, the results
were not suffered to transpire, but remained locked
up in the secret archives of the viceroys and of the
council of the Indies; where probably they would
have been hidden to this day had not the South
Americans assumed the management of their own
affairs.</p>

<p>In the confusion which followed the deposition of
the Spanish authorities, the public archives appear
to have been ransacked with little ceremony, and
many documents of great interest were lost, or fell
into the hands of individuals who, like collectors of
rarities in other parts of the world, showed anything
but a disposition to share them with the public at
large. I will not say that this was always the case,
but the feeling prevailed to a sufficient extent to enhance
materially the value of those which were either
offered for sale or obtainable by other means.</p>

<p>Some few individuals were actuated by a different
spirit, amongst whom I ought especially to name
Dr. Segurola, the fellow-labourer with Dean Funes
in his historical essay upon the provinces of La Plata,
whose valuable collection of MSS. (from which that
work was principally compiled) was always accessible
to his friends, and to whom I have to acknow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>ledge
my own obligations for leave to take copies of
many an interesting paper. Others, also, whom I do
not name, will I trust not the less accept my thanks
for the facilities they afforded me for obtaining such
information as I required. The government, I must
say, was always liberal, in giving me access to the
old archives, and in permitting me to transcribe documents<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which I could not have obtained from other
quarters.</p>

<p>With these facilities, and by purchase, I found
myself, by the time I quitted South America, in
possession of a considerable collection of MS. maps
and of unedited papers respecting countries of which
the greater part of the world is, I believe, in almost
absolute ignorance.</p>

<p>Amongst the most interesting perhaps of these I
may mention&mdash;</p>

<p>The original Diaries of Don Juan de la Piedra,
sent out from Spain, in 1778, to explore the coasts of
Patagonia.</p>

<p>A series of papers drawn up by his successors the
Viedmas, the founders of the settlements at San
Julian and on the Rio Negro.</p>

<p>The original Journal of Don Basilio Villari&ntilde;o,
who, in 1782, explored the great river Negro, from
its mouth in lat. 41&deg; to the foot of the Andes, within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
three days' journey of Valdivia, on the shores of the
Pacific.</p>

<p>The Narrative, by Don Luis de la Cruz, of his
Journey through the territory of the Indians and the
unexplored parts of the Pampas, from Antuco, in the
south of Chili, to Buenos Ayres, in 1806.</p>

<p>The Diary of Don Pedro Garcia's Expedition to
the Salinas, in 1810, given me by my most estimable
friend, his son, Don Manuel.</p>

<p>Together with a variety of other unpublished
accounts of the Indian territories south of Buenos
Ayres, principally collected by order of that government,
with a view to the extension of their frontiers.</p>

<p>The substance of these papers, all which relate
to the southern and least known parts of the New
Continent, will be found in Chapters VII., VIII.,
and IX.</p>

<p>Respecting the eastern or Littorine provinces of
the Republic, as I have ventured to call them,
the most valuable data existing are, first, those
collected by the Jesuits, and next, the various reports
and memoirs drawn up by the officers employed
to fix the boundaries under the treaties
between Spain and Portugal of 1750 and 1777.
The especial qualifications of the individuals, particularly
of those employed in the last case, the length
of time spent upon the service (more than twenty
years), and the enormous expenses incurred by Spain
in the endeavour to complete that survey, led to a
large accumulation of invaluable geographical data<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
respecting extensive ranges of country never before
properly examined, much less described.</p>

<p>Nor were the labours of the officers in question
confined to the frontiers. They fixed, as I have
stated in Chapter VIII., all the principal points
in the province of Buenos Ayres, made surveys
of the great rivers Paran&atilde; and Uruguay, and of
their most important tributaries; and drew up many
notices of great interest respecting the countries bordering
upon the higher parts of the Paraguay, which
the pretensions of the Portuguese in that direction
rendered it requisite for them to explore with more
than ordinary care and attention<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>M. Walckenaer's publication at Paris, in 1809, of
the Travels of Don Felix Azara, one of the King
of Spain's commissioners on that service, contains a
general review of the labours of those officers, and is
perhaps the best work in print upon the countries
which it describes; still it can only be regarded as a
very imperfect sketch of the information collected by
one of many able men employed upon that particular
service.</p>

<p>Another of the commissioners, Don Diego Alvear,
drew up an historical and geographical work upon
the provinces of Paraguay and the Missions, quite
equal in interest, if not more so, than that by Azara,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
for a MS. copy of which I have to thank his son, the
present General Alvear.</p>

<p>Colonel Cabrer, the only surviving officer of all
those employed on this important survey, was living
during the time I was at Buenos Ayres, and for many
years had, to my knowledge, been engaged in drawing
up an elaborate account of the whole progress of the
survey from first to last; in his possession I saw a
complete set of all the beautiful maps executed by the
Spanish officers, the originals of which are deposited
at Madrid. He is lately dead, and I understand that
the authorities of Buenos Ayres have been in treaty
for the purchase of his papers, which will be of the
greatest importance, not only to them, but to the
governments of the Banda Oriental, of Paraguay,
and of Bolivia, whenever the time comes, as it must
ere long, for definitively fixing their respective boundaries
with Brazil. I considered myself fortunate in
obtaining copies of several detached portions of these
surveys, and particularly of an original map, drawn
from them by Colonel Cabrer himself for General
Alvear, when commanding-in-chief in the Banda
Oriental in 1827.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, so far as the Spanish
frontiers extended, these maps are the best existing
data respecting the countries which they delineate:
on the other hand, we must look to the Portuguese
authorities for materials for the adjoining provinces
of Brazil. The most perfect map of that part of
the continent perhaps ever made was drawn at Rio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
de Janeiro in 1827, for the use of the Marquis of
Barbacena, when appointed to command the Emperor's
army in the war with Buenos Ayres, and was
taken with his baggage at the battle of Ituzaingo,
and afterwards given to me. It comprises, on a
large scale, all the country lying east of the Uruguay,
from the Island of St. Catharine's to the River Plate.
On my return to England I placed it in the hands of
Mr. John Arrowsmith, with the rest of my geographical
materials.</p>

<p>As regards the greater part of the interior provinces
west of the Paraguay, the information obtainable
is very imperfect; indeed of some vast portions
of those regions, it may be said that nothing but the
general courses of the principal rivers is as yet
known. The immense tract called the Gran-Chaco
is still in possession of aboriginal tribes, and other
extensive districts are inhabited by people who,
though of a different race, seem little beyond them in
civilization.</p>

<p>It was not the policy of Spain to take the trouble
of accurately examining her colonial possessions,
except when obliged to do so in furtherance of measures
of self-defence, or in the expectation of some
profitable return in the precious metals, the primary
objects of her solicitude: and, but that the high road
from Potosi to Buenos Ayres ran through them, I
believe in Europe we should hardly have known, till
recently, even the names of the capital towns of the
intermediate provinces: it is only since their inde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>pendence
that they have brought themselves into
notice, and that any information has been acquired
of the nature and importance of their native products.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Buenos Ayres in 1824, in
hopes of obtaining the best existing accounts of their
statistics, I addressed myself to the governors themselves;
and I have every reason to believe, under the
circumstances, that they were desirous to meet my
wishes. I received from them all the most civil assurances
to that effect; but, excepting from the Entre
Rios, Cordova, La Rioja, and Salta, I found the authorities
themselves utterly unable to communicate
anything of a definite or satisfactory nature; and,
although they promised to set to work to collect
what I asked for, I soon found they had most of
them other matters on hand which had more urgent
calls on their attention.</p>

<p>Of the information which I did so obtain, the most
complete by far was from General Arenales, the
Governor of Salta, who not only forwarded to
me an interesting report upon the extent and various
productions of that province, but, what I less expected,
a very fair map of it, drawn by his own son
Colonel Arenales; an individual who has since distinguished
himself amongst his countrymen by the
publication of a work<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> wherein he has with great
pains collected all the information he could obtain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
elucidate the geography and capabilities of a province
which nature seems to have destined to be one of the
most important of the Argentine Republic. Were
his good example followed by equally intelligent individuals
in other parts of the interior, the natives,
as well as foreigners, would be greatly assisted in
learning not only what are the productions of their
own country, but in what manner they might be rendered
available in furtherance of its prosperity.</p>

<p>He has done his duty, and rendered a service to
his country, by pointing out the great importance of
the possibility, now proved beyond a doubt, of navigating
the river Vermejo throughout its whole
course, from Oran in the heart of the continent to its
junction with the Paran&atilde;, and thence to the ocean.</p>

<p>Mr. Arrowsmith has adopted his delineation of
the course of that river, as laid down from the diary
of Cornejo, who descended it in 1790. Soria, who
came down it in 1826, was deprived of all his papers
in Paraguay; and although, on reaching Buenos
Ayres, five years afterwards, he not only published
a short account of his voyage, but a map also to
illustrate it, being entirely from memory, it is little
to be depended upon; neither is it reconcilable with
the distance from Oran to the Paraguay, as estimated
either by himself or Cornejo.</p>

<p>Of Soria's voyage, besides his own account, I had
a much more full and curious narrative from an
Englishman of the name of Luke Cresser, who was
one of the party, and whose personal adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
would form an entertaining episode in any history
of that enterprise. He was a Yorkshireman by
birth, and originally a watchmaker, in which trade,
after making a little money at Buenos Ayres, he
had found his way into the upper provinces, and had
finally become a grower of tobacco in the province
of Oran. Having a large stock on hand about the
time Soria was about to descend the Vermejo, he
was induced to ship it, and to embark with him for
Buenos Ayres. He was of the greatest service to
the party on the voyage, and was severely wounded,
in the skirmish they had with the Indians, by an
arrow, which pierced his arm, and occasioned him
much and long suffering afterwards. On reaching
the Paraguay, had Soria listened to his urgent
advice and entreaties, he never would have placed
himself in Dr. Francia's power; for which, indeed,
there does not appear to have been the slightest
necessity. When the vessel was detained by that
despot's orders, Cresser, like the rest, was stripped
of all he possessed; and, after much suffering, was
sent to Villa Real,&mdash;a wretched establishment on the
Paraguay, about 150 miles above Assumption.</p>

<p>There, whilst his companions were bewailing their
fate, the more enterprising Englishman obtained
leave to proceed into the interior to the forests,
where the yerba or tea is gathered, to work for his
livelihood; and with such success, that, from beginning
without a dollar of his own, by the time he was
allowed to leave Paraguay, five years afterwards, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
found himself in comparative affluence; and, though
only permitted by the dictator to carry out of the
country a portion of the yerba he had by his industry
collected, he had still enough left when he sailed for
Buenos Ayres to compensate him for the loss of all
the tobacco with which he had originally sailed from
Oran. The narrative of this person contains such
curious details, not only respecting his residence in
Paraguay, but also regarding the country about
Oran, where he had passed some years previously to
his voyage with Soria down the Vermejo, that I have
thought it worth communicating to the Geographical
Society for insertion, if they please, at length, in one
of their periodical journals.</p>

<p>If it was difficult to collect the most ordinary
statistical data relative to the interior, it may easily
be supposed how much more so it was to obtain information
of any interest in a scientific point of view;
nevertheless, in this respect, I was not altogether
without resources; and the accidental residence of
two or three observing and intelligent individuals of
our own countrymen in the remotest parts of these
widely-spread regions laid open to me sources of
information even upon such matters as I little expected.
The results of that portion of my correspondence
will be found in various parts of this Volume,
where I have had the satisfaction of acknowledging
my obligations to the individuals from whom they
were derived.</p>

<p>From the materials to which I have above alluded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
and other papers in my possession, my original intention
was to have attempted a work of a more extensive
nature; but any necessity for this has been since
superseded by the publication, which has been commenced
by M. de Angelis, at Buenos Ayres, under
the auspices of the Government, of an extensive collection
of unedited historical documents relative to
the provinces of La Plata.</p>

<p>In the course of the last three years five folio
volumes, and portions of two more, have already appeared,
in which not only many of the most interesting
of the papers in my own collection are given,
but a variety of others throwing great light upon
the history and geography of the countries to which
they relate<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot hesitate to say that it is infinitely the
most important and interesting publication which has
as yet appeared in any of the new states of Spanish
America, to the great credit of the enlightened editor,
who has illustrated it with his own learned notes and
observations, the fruits of a long study of the history
of his adopted country.</p>

<p>Upon the appearance of the first volumes I gave
up my own design, as a work of supererogation
where one so much more valuable was attainable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>
<p>It became however manifest, as M. de Angelis'
work proceeded, that its extent would rather render it
available as a book of reference and authority than
for general purposes; and, as it was in the Spanish
language, particularly so for the general purposes of
English readers. I was again, therefore, induced to
resume my task, though with the essential change
in its character from my original plan, to the brief
and general sketch of the Republic, and of the progress
of geography in that part of the world during
the last 60 years, which now appears; referring those
who desire more detailed information to the invaluable
collection of original memoirs now in course of
publication by Don Pedro de Angelis: it has been of
great use to me in enabling me to complete my own
chain of information, as indeed it must be to any
one who pretends to give any account of the part of
the world of which the documents it contains may
be said now to constitute the original and authenticated
historical records.</p>

<p>To M. de Angelis I am also indebted for the copy
of a MS. map, by Don Alvarez de Condarco, in
which are laid down not only a recent journey of his
own in 1837, to examine the mines in the Indian territory
south of the Diamante, but the several marches
of the troops, detached from Mendoza, in 1833, to
co-operate with the forces from Buenos Ayres under
General Rosas, in the general attack made upon the
native tribes. I had already received, as I have mentioned
in Chapter IX., through my friend Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
Manuel Garcia, a map drawn by General Pacheco,
showing the march of the principal division of that
army, along the banks of the River Negro, from the
Islands of Choleechel to the junction of the Neuquen.</p>

<p>The routes in question have been very material to
the laying down of the true courses of some of the
many rivers which constitute the most important,
though hitherto undescribed, features of that part of
the continent:&mdash;and it is satisfactory to find that
they are strikingly corroborative of the accounts, as
far as they go, which I had already cited as given
both by Villari&ntilde;o, by Don Luis de la Cruz, and our
own countryman, Dr. Gillies.</p>

<p>Thus far I have spoken of my geographical materials:&mdash;they
will be found embodied in the accompanying
map of the Republic by Mr. John Arrowsmith,
who has spared no time or labour in its
construction. In this he has also availed himself of
the invaluable recent survey of Captain FitzRoy, to
give the whole of the line of coast upon the very best
authority. In the interior the various routes, which
appear now for the first time collected together, have
been all re-protracted from the original sources of
information, whilst a careful re-examination of the
labours of the Boundary Commissioners and of other
authenticated authorities has enabled him to correct
many errors of position which had crept, I hardly
know how, into the latest maps, not excepting those
compiled in the topographical department of Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the whole, although we have yet a vast deal
to learn before any perfect map can be drawn of this
extensive portion of the new continent, I trust that
the present attempt will be regarded as no slight
improvement upon our old geography of that part
of the world<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>I regret that I lost, during my residence at Buenos
Ayres, the opportunity of making what too late I
learnt would have been very acceptable additions
to our zoological collections; but I never imagined
that our public museums were so entirely destitute,
as I found them upon my return, of specimens of the
commonest objects of natural history, from a country
with which we had been so many years in, I may
say, almost daily intercourse. Mr. Darwin, and
the officers of His Majesty's ship Beagle, have
since done much to supply these deficiencies; but
we still want, I believe, specimens of by far the
greater part of the birds and beasts of which Azara
gave us the description nearly forty years ago. The
collections of some of the museums on the Continent
are, I believe, much more complete; especially those
of Paris, to judge from the accounts of the acquisitions
made by M. Alcide d'Orbigny, the fruits of
many years spent in those countries, to which he was
sent in 1826, expressly, I believe, to collect information
and specimens for the Museum of Natural
History.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>
<p>Instigated first by Dr. Buckland, I made those
inquiries for fossil remains, the results of which I
flatter myself have been of no common interest both
to the geologist and comparative anatomist. The examination
of the monstrous bones which I sent to this
country, by the learned individuals who have taken
the pains to describe them, assists us to unravel the
fabulous traditions handed down by the aborigines respecting
a race of Titans, whilst it proves indisputably
that the vast alluvial plains in that part of the world,
at some former period, the further history of which
has not been revealed to us, were inhabited by herbivorous
animals of most extraordinary dimensions, and
of forms greatly differing from those of the genera
now in existence.</p>

<p>To the account of the Megatherium, and other
extinct animals, I am now enabled, by a delay which
has unavoidably occurred in the publication of this
volume, to insert the representation of another extinct
monster, the Glyptodon, which has been very recently
discovered at no great distance from the city
of Buenos Ayres, apparently in a very perfect state, and
which I trust ere long will be in England. Mr. Owen,
of the College of Surgeons, has been good enough to
draw up for me the description of it, which I have
added in a note at the end of the tenth chapter.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not unworthy of a passing observation
here, that, amongst all the remains of extinct animals
which we have now obtained from the Pampas, most
of which too seem to have been singularly provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
with a structure for self-defence, no instance, I
believe, has as yet been satisfactorily proved of the
occurrence of any portion of a <i>carnivorous</i> animal.</p>

<p>It only remains for me to allude to the third and
last part of my book, upon the trade and public debt
of the provinces of La Plata; and of which I can
only say that I have spared no inquiry to render it
as correct as is compatible with so brief and general
a notice. The accounts officially published by the
Government of Buenos Ayres, and the papers laid
before Parliament, have enabled me to complete the
Returns of Trade to the close of 1837. They show
that the River Plate to the British manufacturer has
been the most important of all the markets opened to
him by the emancipation of the Spanish Americans;
and that the value of the British trade there alone
exceeds the aggregate of all other foreign countries
put together. Spain herself has not taken for many
years past so large a quantity of British manufactured
goods as, it appears, have been sent to the
River Plate.</p>

<p>The particulars of the debt have only been brought
down to the commencement of 1837; for, although
the accounts have since been published for another
year, I confess I do not sufficiently understand them
at this distance to attempt to explain them, further
than to say that they show increased difficulties,
from the lamentable and unexpected circumstances
which have again disturbed the peace of the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>On the party questions which have hitherto agitated
the people of these countries, I have purposely
said as little as possible; much less have I thought
of writing the history of a country which has not
been a quarter of a century in existence; the institutions
of which are quite in their infancy, and must
necessarily require a long period ere they can assume
a more definite character.</p>

<p>The generality of my readers, I take it for granted,
are acquainted with the nature of the old colonial
government of Spain, with the events which led to
the emancipation of the South Americans, and with
the fact of their having declared for a democratic
form of government in all the new states.</p>

A dispute with the Araucanian Indians prevents his communication with the Spaniards of Chile, and obliges him to return. Piedra succeeds Viedma, attacks the Pampa Tribes, and is defeated.

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

DIVISIONS AND PRESENT STATE OF THE REPUBLIC.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Extent, Divisions, and General Government of the Provinces of
La Plata. Jurisdiction of the old Viceroyalties:&mdash;Necessity of
dividing and subdividing such vast Governments:&mdash;Embarrassments
arising out of this necessity. The backwardness in the
Political organization of these Provinces, common to all the new
Republics of South America; and attributable to the same
cause; the Colonial system of the Mother Country. Mistake in
comparing the condition of the Creoles with that of the British
Colonists of North America. Natural ascendency of Military
Power in the new States. Their progress in the last twenty-five
years compared with their previous condition.</p></div>


<p>The United Provinces of La Plata, or, as they are
sometimes called, the Argentine Republic, comprise,
(with the exception of Paraguay and the Banda
Oriental, which have become separate and independent
states) the whole of that vast space lying
between Brazil and the Cordillera of Chile and
Peru, and extending from the 22nd to the 41st
degree of south latitude.</p>

<p>The most southern settlement of the Buenos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Ayreans as yet is the little town of Del Carmen,
upon the river Negro.</p>

<p>The native Indians are in undisturbed possession
of all beyond, as far as Cape Horn.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the Republic may be said to
be bounded on the north by Bolivia; on the west
by Chile; on the east by Paraguay, the Banda Oriental,
and the Atlantic Ocean; and on the south by
the Indians of Patagonia. Altogether, it contains
about 726,000 square miles English, with a population
of from 600,000 to 700,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p>This vast territory is now subdivided into thirteen
Provinces, assuming to govern themselves, to a certain
degree, independently of each other; though,
for all general and national purposes, confederated
by conventional agreements.</p>

<p>For want of a more defined National Executive,
the Provincial Government of Buenos Ayres is temporarily
charged with carrying on the business of the
Union with foreign Powers, and with the management
of all matters appertaining to the Republic in
common. The Executive Power of that Government,
as constituted in 1821, is vested in the Governor, or
Captain General<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, as he is styled, aided by a Council
of ministers appointed by himself&mdash;responsible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the junta or legislative Assembly of the Province by
whom he is elected. The junta itself consists of
forty-four deputies, one-half of whom are annually
renewed by popular election.</p>

<p>Geographically, these Provinces may be divided
into three principal sections:&mdash;1st, the Littorine,
or eastern; 2nd, the Central, or northern; 3rd,
those to the west of Buenos Ayres, commonly called
the provinces of Cuyo.</p>

<p>The Littorine Provinces are, Buenos Ayres, and
Santa F&eacute;, to the west, and Entre Rios and Corrientes
to the east of the River Paran&atilde;. Those in
the Central section, on the high road to Peru,
are Cordova, Santiago del Estero, Tucuman, and
Salta; to which may be added, Catamarca, and La
Rioja. Those lying west of Buenos Ayres, and
which formerly constituted the Intendency of Cuyo,
are San Luis, Mendoza, and San Juan.</p>

<p>All these together now form the confederation of
the United Provinces of La Plata.</p>

<p>Under the Spanish rule, the Viceroyalty of
Buenos Ayres comprehended further, the provinces
of Upper Peru, now called Bolivia; as well as Paraguay,
and the Banda Oriental: and immense as this
jurisdiction appears for one government, it was but
a portion separated from that of the old viceroys of
Peru, whose nominal authority at one time extended
from Guayaquil to Cape Horn, over 55 degrees of
latitude, comprising almost every habitable climate
under the sun; innumerable nations, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
various languages, and every production which can
minister to the wants of man.</p>

<p>To Spain, it was a convenience and saving of
expense to divide her American possessions into as
few governments as possible; and under her colonial
system, without a hope of improving their social
condition, their native industry discouraged, and the
very fruits of the soil forbidden them, in order to
ensure a sale for those of the mother country, it was
of little consequence to the generality of the people
by what viceroy they were ruled, or at what distance
from them he resided.</p>

<p>It became, however, a very different matter when
that colonial system was overthrown, and succeeded
by native governments of their own election. Then,
all the many and various distinctions of climate,
of language, of habits, and productions, burst into
notice; and as they separately put forward their
claims to consideration, the difficulty, if not impossibility,
became manifest, of adequately providing for
them by the newly-constituted authorities, which,
although succeeding to all the jurisdiction of the
viceroys, repudiated <i>in limine</i> the principles of the
system under which such discordant interests had
hitherto been controlled and held together.</p>

<p>The consequence has been, that most of the new
states in their very infancy have been subjected
to the embarrassing necessity of re-casting their
governments, and dividing and subdividing their
extensive territories, as the varying and distinct in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>terests
of their several component parts have shown
to be requisite for their due protection and development.
Nothing has tended more to retard the organization
and improvement of their political institutions
than this necessity; and nowhere has it
been more strikingly exemplified than in the widely-spread
provinces of La Plata. In the first years of
the struggle with the mother country, one common
object, paramount to all other considerations, the
complete establishment of their political independence,
bound them together&mdash;perhaps I should more
correctly say, prevented their separation;&mdash;but the
very circumstances of that struggle, and the vicissitudes
of the war, which often for long periods together
cut off their communications with the capital,
and with each other; obliging them to provide
separately for their own temporary government and
security, gave rise in many of them, especially those
at a distance, to habits of more or less independence,
which, as they imperceptibly acquired strength, produced
in some, as in Paraguay and Upper Peru, an
entire separation from Buenos Ayres; and in others
such an assumption of the management of their own
provincial affairs, as ere long reduced the metropolitan
government to a nullity.</p>

<p>It is true that, up to 1820, the semblance of a
Central Government was maintained at Buenos
Ayres, but in that year the unpopularity of the
measures of the Directory and of the National Congress
led to its final dissolution, under circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
which precluded all hope of its re-establishment,
and terminated in the system of federalism, which
has ever since <i>de facto</i> subsisted.</p>

<p>Experience has taught Buenos Ayres the inefficacy
of forcible measures to bring back the provinces
under her more immediate control; and
though congresses have been more than once convoked
for the purpose of establishing something
more definite as to the form, at least, of their national
government, whether central or federal, individual
and local interests have always prevailed in
thwarting such an arrangement; and the probability
now is, that for a long time to come the national
organization of this State will be limited to the
slender bonds of voluntary confederation, which at
present constitute the <i>soi-disant</i> union of the provinces,
not only with each other, but with their old
metropolis, Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose here to enter into the history
of the domestic troubles and civil dissensions which
brought about this state of things in the new republic:
it is an unsatisfactory, and to most of my
readers would be a very unintelligible, narrative.
Suffice it to say, that whilst the political importance
of Buenos Ayres has been apparently not a
little diminished; on the other hand, it may be questioned
if the provinces have reaped any substantial
advantage by shaking off their immediate dependence
upon the metropolis. Most of them have
suffered all the calamitous consequences of party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
struggles for power, and have fallen under the arbitrary
rule of the military chiefs, who, in turn, have
either by fair means or foul obtained the ascendency;
and if in some of them the semblance of
a representative junta has been set up in imitation
of that of Buenos Ayres, it will be found, I believe,
that such assemblies have, in most instances, proved
little more than an occasional convocation of the
partisans of the governor for the time being, much
more likely to confirm than to control his despotic
sway.</p>

<p>The present political state of the provinces of La
Plata is certainly very different from what was expected
by the generality of those who originally
took an interest in the fate of these new countries.
It is, however, a state of things not confined to this
republic; we shall find, more or less, the same
scenes; the same violent party struggles, the same
continual changes of government; the same apparent
incapacity for arriving at anything like a settled
political organization in almost every one of the
several independent states into which the old possessions
of Spain on the New Continent have resolved
themselves; and this under circumstances, to all
appearance, the most dissimilar with regard to the
locality, climate, soil, language, wants, and physical
condition of the inhabitants; with no one common
element, in fact, in their composition, save their
having all been brought up in, and habituated to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the same colonial system of the mother country.
What, then, is the conclusion we must draw from
this fact? Is it not evident that it was that
colonial system which, wherever applied, unfitted
the people for a state of independence, and left them
worse than helpless when thrown upon their own
resources?</p>

<p>Well might Spain urge upon other nations, as
an argument against the recognition of those countries,
that the South Americans were unfit for a
state of independence. She knew the full extent
of moral degradation to which her own policy had
reduced them; but it was futile to allege it, when
it had become manifest to all the world that her own
power to reduce them again to subjection was gone
for ever, and that the people of South America had
not only achieved their complete independence, but
were resolved and fully able to maintain it. The
notoriety of those facts left no alternative to foreign
governments whose subjects had any real interest in
the question, whatever might be the speculative
opinions of some parties as to the eventual prospects
of the New States.</p>

<p>In this country our ignorance of the real condition
of the people of South America naturally led
us to look back to what had taken place in our own
North American colonies, and with but little discrimination
perhaps, to anticipate the same results,
whereas nothing in reality could be more dissimilar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
than the circumstances of the colonial subjects of
Great Britain and Spain when their political emancipation
took place.</p>

<p>In the British colonies all the foundations of good
government were already laid: the principles of
civil administration were perfectly understood, and
the transition was almost imperceptible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the Spanish colonies the
whole policy, as well as the power of the mother
country, seems to have been based on perpetuating
the servile state and ignorance of the natives:
branded as an inferior race, they were systematically
excluded from all share in the government, from
commerce, and every other pursuit which might tend
to the development of native talent or industry. The
very history of their own unfortunate country was
forbidden them, no doubt lest it should open their
eyes to the reality of their own debased condition.</p>

<p>When the struggle came, the question of their
independence was soon settled irrevocably; but as
to the elements for the construction at once of anything
like a good government of their own, they
certainly did not exist.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, what was perfectly
natural took place. In the absence of any other
real power, that of military command, which had
grown out of the war, obtained an ascendency, the
influence of which in all the New States became
soon apparent. They fell, in fact, all of them more
or less under military despotism. The people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
dazzled with the victories and martial achievements
of their leaders, imperceptibly passed from one yoke
to another.</p>

<p>It is true that national Congresses and legislative
Assemblies were everywhere convoked; but, generally
aiming at more than was practicable or compatible
with their circumstances, they in most
instances failed, and by their failure rather confirmed
the absolute power of the military chiefs.
They, however, abolished the slave-trade, put an
end to the forced service of the mita, so grievous
to the Indians, and nominally sanctioned more or
less the liberty of the press,&mdash;measures which gained
them popularity and support amongst men of liberal
principles in Europe, who fancied they saw in them
expressions of public opinion, and evidences of a fitness
amongst the people at large for free institutions;
but this was an error.</p>

<p>The people of South America, with the Laws of
the Indies still hanging about their necks, shouted
indeed with their leaders, "Independence and Liberty,"
and gallantly fought for and established the
first; but as to liberty, in our sense of the word at
least, they knew very little about it:&mdash;how could
they?</p>

<p>They have yet practically to learn that true liberty
in a civilized state of society can only really exist
where the powers of the ruling authorities are duly
defined and balanced; and where the laws&mdash;not the
colonial laws of Old Spain&mdash;are so administered as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
ensure to every citizen a prompt redress for wrongs,
entire personal security, and the right of freely expressing
his political opinions. The working of
such laws makes men habitually free and fit for the
enjoyment of free institutions. But such a state of
things is not brought about in a day or in a generation,
nor can it be produced by any parchment
constitution, however perfect in theory. The experiment
has been tried of late years in some of the
oldest states of Europe, and has invariably failed.
Is it then reasonable that we should expect it to be
more successful in such infant states as these new
republics? Time&mdash;and we, of all people in the
world, ought best to know how long a time&mdash;is requisite
to bring such good fruit to maturity.</p>

<p>Education, the press, a daily intercourse with the
rest of the world, and experience not the less valuable
because dearly bought, are all tending gradually
to enlighten the inhabitants of these new countries,
and to prepare them for their future destinies. And,
although from a variety of causes, their advancement
may appear slow, and their present state fall far short
of what has been expected of them, the truth is,
they have made immense progress, compared with
their old condition under the colonial yoke of Spain;&mdash;and
especially, I will say so, of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

RIVER PLATE.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The River Plate&mdash;why so called. Its immensity. Arrival off
Buenos Ayres. Passengers carted on shore. Want of a better
landing-place, for goods especially. Navigation of the River
not so perilous as was supposed in former times.</p></div>


<p>The river Plate, or La Plata, was originally named
after De Solis, who first entered it in 1515. Some
years afterwards, Sebastian Cabot, ascending it above
its junction with the Paran&atilde;, found silver ornaments
amongst the natives; and thence believing, or desiring
to induce others to believe, that that precious
metal abounded on its shores, he gave it the false
appellation by which it has ever since been known.</p>

<p>It is a singular coincidence, that thus the two
mightiest rivers of the South American continent,
indeed two of the most remarkable rivers of the
world, the Plata, and the Amazons, should derive
their names from fictions, rather than from those
brave adventurers who first made them known, and
to whom the honour was the more justly due; as
both of them, Orellana, as well as De Solis, lost
their lives in the prosecution of those particular
discoveries.</p>

<p>But one feeling takes possession of the stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
on his arrival off this wonderful river&mdash;that of
amazement at the immensity of its extent; a hundred
miles before he enters it, he may have seen its turbid
current, and had to struggle with its influence in
the ocean itself<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. At its mouth, from Cape St.
Mary's to Cape St. Antonio, its width is 170 miles.
Farther up, between Santa Lucia, near Monte
Video, and the point of Las Piedras on its southern
bank, within which its waters are generally fresh,
it is double<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the distance across from Dover to
Calais.</p>

<p>But for that positive freshness, the stranger can
hardly credit that he is not still at sea. He has
yet to sail up it nearly two hundred miles ere he
reaches the anchorage off Buenos Ayres, and then,
at the end of his voyage, if the ship be large<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, he
will probably find it difficult to make out the land.</p>

<p>It is only from the pozos, or inner roads, that the
city becomes visible in its full extent, ranging along
a slightly elevated ridge, which bounds the river.
The towers of the churches, and here and there a
solitary Umb&uacute; tree, alone break an outline almost
as level as the horizon of the river itself. There is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
back-ground to the picture, no mountains, no trees;
one vast continuous plain beyond extends for nearly
1000 miles unbroken to the Cordillera of Chile.</p>

<p>Unless the weather be perfectly settled, of which
the barometer is the best index, the landing is not
unattended with danger. I have known many a boat
lost in crossing the bar or bank which lies between
the outer and inner roads<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. Nor is the bank the
only danger: thick fogs at times come on, suddenly
enveloping land and water in total darkness without
the slightest previous indication; in such a dilemma,
if a boat be caught without the means of anchoring,
the chances are that she may be carried down the
river by the currents, and the people half-starved
before they are picked up or can find the land again.</p>

<p>But supposing these dangers passed, nothing can
be more inconvenient or strikingly characteristic of
the country than the actual landing. A ship's boat
has seldom water enough to run fairly on shore, and,
or arriving within forty or fifty yards of it, is beset
by carts, always on the watch for passengers, the
whole turn-out of which I defy any other people in
the world to produce anything at all approaching.</p>

<p>On the broad flat axle of a gigantic pair of
wheels, seven or eight feet high, a sort of platform
is fixed of half a dozen boards, two or three inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
apart, letting in the wet at every splash of the water
beneath; the ends are open&mdash;a rude hurdle forms the
side, and a short strong pole from the axle completes
the vehicle; to this unwieldy machine the horse is
simply attached by a ring at the end of the pole,
fastened to the girth or surcingle, round which his
rider has the power of turning him as on a pivot,
and of either drawing or pushing the machine along
like a wheelbarrow, as may be momentarily most
convenient:&mdash;in this manner, for the first time in my
life, I saw the cart fairly before the horse:&mdash;in
Europe we laugh at the idea; in South America
nothing is more common than the reality.</p>

<p>The wild and savage appearance of the tawny
drivers of these carts, half naked, shouting and
screaming and jostling one another, and flogging
their miserable jaded beasts through the water, as if
to show the little value attached to the brute creation
in these countries, is enough to startle a stranger
on his first arrival, and induce him for a moment to
doubt whether he be really landing in a Christian
country. It is a new and a strange specimen of
human kind, little calculated to create a favourable
first impression.</p>

<p>In old times there was a sort of mole, such as it
was, which ran some way into the river, and obviated
a part, at least, of these inconveniences, but it was
either washed or blown down some years ago, and
the people have been too indolent, or too busy ever
since to set about replacing it; not, however, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
want of plans for its reconstruction, amongst which
one for a chain-pier, some years ago submitted to the
government, appeared particularly suited to the locality;
why it was not adopted, I never heard, but it
is no credit to the natives that something of the sort
has not long since been built. Nothing is more
wanted, or more deserving the primary attention of
the authorities, whilst I believe no work they could
undertake would more certainly repay its expenses,
for the convenience to passengers is a small consideration
compared with the value which any commodious
landing-place for merchandise at Buenos
Ayres would be of to the trade. The loss and
damage yearly sustained by the present mode of
carrying goods on shore, in the rude carts I have
described, is incalculable, and highly detrimental to
the port in a commercial point of view.</p>

<p>With respect to the passage up the river, though
somewhat intricate, it is by no means so perilous as
it was long believed to be, probably because the commercial
shipping from Spain rarely ascended higher
than Monte Video, to which Port the country produce
from Buenos Ayres and the interior provinces was
for the most part sent down in small craft for shipment
to Europe.</p>

<p>In 1789 Malaspina commenced the elaborate survey
of the river, afterwards completed by Oyarvide,
and still further corrected by the observations of Captains
Beaufort and Heywood, of the British navy, the
latter of whom, also, published particulars direc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>tions
for the navigation of the several channels
between the banks. With his chart and sailing<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
directions, and due attention to the soundings and
currents, there is now little risk; and that little
would be still farther diminished by the establishment,
long projected, of a floating light off the tail
of the Ortiz bank, and of two or three leading landmarks
opposite to the Chico channel.</p>

<p>The most dangerous parts of the river are buoyed,
and licensed pilots ply off its mouth to take vessels
either into the harbour of Monte Video, or up to
Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>Ships drawing fifteen or sixteen feet water
may ran freely up to the anchorage of that city.
Foreign vessels do not go higher, Buenos Ayres
being at present the only port of entry; indeed,
were it otherwise, and the navigation of the upper
parts of the river thrown open, and declared free,
as some of the provinces have at times wished, it is
not likely that European shipping would ever avail
themselves of it, seeing that the passage up from
Buenos Ayres to Corrientes, besides the additional
risk, would at least occupy as much time as the
whole voyage out from France or England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

CITY OF BUENOS AYRES.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>First Impressions of Buenos Ayres. Date of the Foundation, and
Insignificance of the Colony for a long period. Contraband
Trade carried on through it a grievance to the Mother Country.
Erected into a distinct Viceroyalty in 1776, and its trade opened
in consequence of the modified system adopted by Spain about
the same time. The advantages of this to Buenos Ayres.</p></div>


<p>If my first feelings on being carted ashore at
Buenos Ayres in the uncouth manner I have described,
were none of the most agreeable, they soon
passed off, and gave way to different impressions.
As I walked up to the lodgings which had been
prepared for me, I was struck with the regularity of
the streets and buildings, the appearance of the
churches, the general cheerfulness of the white-stuccoed
houses, and especially with the independent
contented air of the people&mdash;- a striking contrast to the
wretched beggary and slave population, of which I
had lately seen so much at Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>The date of the foundation of this city is comparatively
recent, and long subsequent to the arrival
of the first discoverers of the country, to whom
neither the aspect of the Pampas, nor the warlike
disposition of the Querandis, the then inhabitants,
appear to have offered any attractions. Their search
was for the land of gold and silver, which was evidently
not this: in quest of those precious metals
they ascended the river, and for the most part
settled in the more inviting regions of Paraguay;
hoping from thence to open an easy communication
with the rich countries of Peru.</p>

<p>In 1535 the Adelantado, Don Pedro de Mendoza,
on his way to Paraguay with one of the most
brilliant expeditions ever equipped in Spain for
South America, landed to recruit his people near the
spot where Buenos Ayres now stands, and caused
a fort to be built there for the first time, in which
he left what he supposed a sufficient garrison for its
defence; but he was mistaken&mdash;the warlike natives
as soon as he was gone drove out the Spanish
soldiers, and remained for nearly another half-century
in undisturbed possession of all that part of
the country.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>It was not till the year 1580 that the famous
Don Juan de Garay, then in Paraguay, determined
once more to endeavour to form a permanent settlement
in the same neighbourhood. In this attempt
the Spaniards as before met with a most obstinate
resistance on the part of the natives, who attacked
them armed with their formidable slings (the bolas
now used by the gauchos) and with bows and arrows,
to which they tied burning matches, which set fire not
only to their tents but to their shipping. De Garay's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
little band, which only consisted of sixty men-at-arms,
was at first well nigh overwhelmed by the
number of the savages who poured down upon them
bravely fighting for their lands. On both sides prodigies
of individual valour are related. The death,
however, of the Cacique, who commanded in chief,
seems to have decided the battle; the Indians, seeing
him fall, fled, followed by the victors till they were
weary of killing them: and such was the slaughter
that to this day the scene of the engagement is called
<i>La Matanza</i>, or "the Killing Ground."</p>

<p>After this victory De Garay took formal possession
of the country in the King of Spain's name, and
founded the present city of Buenos Ayres&mdash;<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1580.</p>

<p>For two centuries the settlement thus planted
languished in insignificance, abandoned to its own
resources, and the mother country, to all appearance,
fearing rather than desiring its aggrandizement:
nor was this without cause;&mdash;Spain, in fact,
lost so immensely by the contraband trade carried
on from Peru, through the river Plate, that she
became accustomed to regard with something more
than indifference a possession which in consequence
of her own prohibitory and restrictive system, was
totally unproductive to her, whilst the facilities it
offered for illicit trading made it a fruitful source of
grievance and of disputes with other nations.</p>

<p>The extent, however, of these evils in the course
of time produced their own remedy. The King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Spain at last discovered that a Viceroy at Lima
could not put down the smugglers in the river
Plate, or prevent the continual territorial encroachments
of the Portuguese in the same quarter.</p>

<p>The necessity had long been evident of establishing
a separate and independent authority on
the spot where its vigilance was in daily request, and
in 1776 Buenos Ayres was made the seat of a new
Viceroyalty, and separated from the government of
Peru.</p>

<p>It was about that time, also, that Spain made
most important changes in her colonial system. The
exclusive and pernicious monopoly of the whole
trade of South America, till then possessed by the
merchants of Seville and Cadiz, was put an end to,
and a comparatively free intercourse was, for the first
time, permitted with many ports in the new world,
with which till then it was death to communicate.
Buenos Ayres reaped a large share of the advantages
of this alteration in the commercial views and
policy of the mother country; and from a nest of
smugglers became one of the first trading cities in
Spanish America. The rapid increase of her population,
under these new circumstances, is worth
notice.</p>

<p>In the year 1767, when M. de Bougainville visited

inhabitants did not exceed 20,000.</p>

<p>In 1778, the year in which the port was partially
thrown open under the free-trade regulations of
Spain, as they were called, a census was taken, by
which it appears that the inhabitants of the city and
of its campa&ntilde;a, or country jurisdiction, amounted to
37,679 souls, of which 24,205 belonged to the city,
12,925 to the country, and 549 were members of

<p>To these numbers, however, some, and not an
inconsiderable, addition should be made for short
returns, particularly from the country districts; for,
let it be borne in mind, in examining all such official
estimates of the population of the Spanish colonies,
that, as any attempt on the part of the authorities to
take a census was sure to be regarded as the forerunner
of some new exaction for the service of the
mother country, so it was as certain to be evaded,
especially by the lower orders of the people, and,
in proportion, to fall short of the reality. In this
census it does not appear that the military were
included, but in that year, or the preceding one, no
less than 10,000 men were sent out from Spain
under the command of the Viceroy Cevallos, in
addition to the ordinary forces, to carry on the war
with the Portuguese: a great part of them it may be
assumed never returned, and should therefore be
added to the numbers of the colonists. Making,
then, a fair allowance for these deficiencies in the
census for 1778, the population at that time probably
did not fall short of 50,000 souls; and this
calculation may be rather under than over the
truth.</p>

<p>In 1789, ten years afterwards, Helms, the German
traveller, on his way to Peru, was told by the
Viceroy at Buenos Ayres that the city contained
between 24,000 and 30,000 inhabitants, a calculation
probably founded on the census of 1778, with
his own vague notion of the probable increase upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
it in the interim. No mention is made by him of
the population of the country.</p>

<p>In 1795 the Viceroy Aredondo, on delivering
up the government to his successor, took occasion
to allude to the great increase which had taken
place in the population since the opening of the
trade, and spoke of it as then amounting altogether
to nearly 60,000 souls.</p>

<p>In 1800 Azara calculated it to be 71,668, estimating
40,000 for the city, and 31,668 for the country-towns
and villages within its jurisdiction&mdash;a great
increase since 1778, compared with the past, which
can only be ascribed to the more liberal policy
adopted by Spain, and to the extraordinary impulse
thereby given to the colony. This, however, was
but an indication of the further results to be anticipated
from the removal of those remaining restrictions
which still grievously hampered the energies of
the community, and retarded the development of the
capabilities of a country formed by nature to be a
great commercial emporium. The British invasions
in 1806 and 1807 awakened the Buenos Ayreans to
a sense of their own political importance, and the subsequent
struggle with the mother country for their
independence opened their ports to all the world;
and in nothing are the consequences more strikingly
exemplified than in the extraordinary increase which
since that epoch has taken place in the population,
notwithstanding all the waste of war in all its forms,
foreign and civil, by land and by sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The following Tables of the Marriages, Births,
and Deaths in the city and country districts of the
province for 1822, 1823, 1824, and 1825, are taken
from data published under the authority of the Government;
and the calculations founded upon them
give the most correct idea to be procured of the
extent of the population up to the close of 1825.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the proportion of births to
deaths is in the ratio of about four to three: amongst
the coloured population, the births are very little
more than equal to the deaths; in the city they fall
much short of them; the increase, therefore, is on
the white stock. The births to the marriages appear
to be as nearly five to one.</p>

<p>The <i>Statistical Register</i> of Buenos Ayres assumes
the annual measure of mortality to be one in thirty-two
in the city, and one in forty in the country; and,
taking the average of the results for 1822 and 1823,
arrives at the conclusion that the inhabitants of the
city amounted, at the commencement of 1824, to
81,136, and those of the country to 82,080, making in
all a population of 163,216. If we calculate, according
to the same rule, the mean of the results of the bills of
mortality for the four years ending with 1825, it will
give us a population for the city of 81,616 persons,
and for the country districts of 76,640, in all of
158,256, at the close of 1825; about 5000 less than
the estimate made in the <i>Register</i> two years before,
the falling off being in the country: but this is at
once accounted for by the recruiting which took
place in 1825 for the war with Brazil, which must
have taken off a much larger number: allowing for
which, I think we may fairly assume that the total
population of the city and province of Buenos Ayres
at the close of that year was not far short of 165,000
souls, being, as nearly as we have the means of calculating,
about double what it was twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
before. At the time I am writing, ten years afterwards,
I have not a doubt that it amounts to nearly
200,000<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>As an additional exemplification of the increase
which has taken place in the population since the
time of M. de Bougainville, I annex a plan of the
city, showing what were its limits in his time, and
what has been added since.</p>

<p>From the numbers let us turn to the general composition
of this population.</p>

<p>The census of 1778 divided it into five castes.</p>

<p>1. The Spaniards and their descendants born in
America, generally known as Creoles.</p>

<p>2. The native Indians.</p>

<p>3. The Mestizoes&mdash;offspring of the Spaniard and
Indian.</p>

<p>4. The Mulattoes&mdash;offspring of the Spaniard and
Negro.</p>

<p>5. The Negroes or Africans born.</p>

<p>Of these five castes, however, the Indians and
their Mestizo offspring formed a very small and insignificant
proportion, and can only be regarded as
accidentally domiciliated at Buenos Ayres in consequence
of its being at that time the principal
channel of communication between Peru, their
proper soil, and Spain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill-p28facing-foldout.jpg" width="700" height="542" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>The City of</i>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>The original Indians of Buenos Ayres were a hostile
race, who would hold no intercourse with their conquerors.
No mixture, therefore, of Spanish and native
blood took place in that particular part of South
America, which could produce a distinct caste, as in
the Upper Provinces and in Peru, where the more
peaceable and domesticated inhabitants continue to the
present day to constitute the main stock of the population.
In those parts we see a striking difference
in the people; the further we advance into the interior,
the more scarce become the white in proportion
to the coloured inhabitants. The aboriginal Indian
blood decidedly predominates in the Mestizo castes,
whilst the negro and his Mulatto descendants, so
common on the coast, are there almost unknown.
The cause of this is easily explained; for a long
period very few European women reached the interior
of America: the Spaniards, therefore, who
settled there, were under the necessity of mixing
with the natives, from which connexion has arisen
that numerous race, the Mestizoes, which forms so
large a part of the present population of those countries.
The same difficulty in transporting their
women from Europe did not occur with respect to
Buenos Ayres; there the European stock was easily
kept up, though for a long period it increased but
slowly; and, but for the adventitious circumstance of
its having been for some years a dep&ocirc;t for the slave-trade,
under the Asiento Treaties, the population of
Buenos Ayres would have been nearly free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
be seen that the Indian and Mestizo no longer
appear: the division made is simply into the white
and the coloured population; and, although the latter
still at that time amounted to nearly a fourth part of
the whole, it had ceased to increase. In the four
years the births barely exceeded the deaths, and
whilst the proportion of deaths amongst the coloured
people increased, there was a striking falling off in
the number of their marriages and births, even from
1822 to 1825. The slave-trade has in fact, been
prohibited since 1813, by a decree of the Constituent
Assembly, consequently any further supply from the
Negro stock has ceased, and it cannot be very long
ere all trace of its having ever existed must be
merged in the rapid increase of the whites&mdash;a result
which will be greatly accelerated by the introduction
of fresh settlers from Europe, who are daily arriving
and domiciliating themselves in the new republic.
Of the extent of this some notion may be formed
when I state that the number of foreigners, who, up
to 1832, had fixed themselves in the city and province
of Buenos Ayres, amounted, with their wives
and children, to no less than from 15,000 to 20,000
persons. Of these, about two-thirds were British
and French, in about equal proportions; the remainder
was made up of Italians, Germans, and
people of other countries, not the least numerous of
whom were emigrants from the United States, and
especially from New York.</p>

<p>As it may interest some of my readers to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
what classes of our countrymen find employment at
Buenos Ayres, I have given in the Appendix an
account of them, as taken from a register which I
established on my own arrival there, together with
the marriages, births, and deaths amongst them, as
far as they could be learned for the period stated: to
these I have further added a copy of the Treaty
I concluded with the Government of Buenos Ayres,
in 1825, securing to His Majesty's subjects in that
country many important privileges, and amongst the
rest the free exercise of their own religion:&mdash;a great
object to so numerous a community:&mdash;I had subsequently
the satisfaction of seeing it fully carried out
by the erection of an English church, capable of containing
1000 persons, towards which the Buenos
Ayrean Government itself contributed, by giving
a valuable plot of ground for the purpose:&mdash;His
Majesty's Government appointed the chaplain, and
regularly defrays one half of the annual expense,
the British residents paying the remainder. A
Presbyterian chapel has been since built in virtue
of the same privilege by the Scotch part of the community;
and for the Catholics, an Irish priest is
allowed to do duty in one of the national churches.</p>

<p>In a population so intermixed, and in such daily
communication with the people of other countries, it
is not surprising that national peculiarities should
have very nearly disappeared. Thus the men of the
better classes in Buenos Ayres are hardly to be distinguished
in their dress from the French and Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>lish
merchants who have fixed themselves amongst
them, whilst the ladies vie with each other in imitating
the last fashions from Paris: it is only in
their out-door costume that any difference is apparent;
then the more becoming mantilla and shawl
thrown over the head and shoulders supersede the
European bonnet and pelisse. Some of them are
very beautiful, and their polite and obliging manners,
especially to strangers, render them doubly attractive.
Our countrymen have formed many matrimonial
connexions with them, which has contributed, no
doubt, to the good feeling with which they are so
generally regarded by the natives.</p>

<p>Education, it is true, has not as yet made great
progress amongst them, but in this improvement is
taking place, and if the young ladles of Buenos
Ayres do not study history and geography, they are
adepts in many pleasing accomplishments; they
dance with great grace, and sing and play very
prettily; the piano-forte, indeed, is a constant resource
morning as well as evening in every respectable
house.</p>

<p>Amongst the men there are native poets, whose
productions do honour to the Spanish language. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
collection of them, called <i>La Lira Argentina</i>, was
printed in 1823, which is well worth the notice of
all lovers of Spanish verse. But the men have more
advantages as respects education than the ladies:
in their schools and universities they are now very
fairly grounded in most branches of general knowledge,
and of late years it has been much the custom
amongst the better families to send their sons to
Europe to complete their studies.</p>

<p>I should say of them in general that they are observing
and intelligent, and extremely desirous to
improve themselves.</p>

<p>Their ordinary habits are certainly a good deal
influenced by climate: I cannot speak of them as
an industrious people, and yet it is rare to see a
man who has not some nominal occupation.</p>

<p>From the number of <i>doctores</i>, a stranger might
suppose that all the upper classes were lawyers or
physicians. This is not exactly the case; but, as that
degree serves to mark the man who has received a
liberal education, it is generally taken by those who
pass through the schools, without particular reference
to their future calling. Thus I have known
<i>doctores</i> in all pursuits&mdash;ministers of state, <i>employ&eacute;s</i>
of all sorts, clerks in public offices, military officers,
and merchants; all attaching to it the same importance
as we do, perhaps with less right, to the ordinary
title of esquire as the designation of a gentleman.</p>

<p>Law and physic, however, do give employment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
revolution in this, as in other Catholic countries, has
put an end to the unconstitutional influence exercised
by them in old times, and under different circumstances:
the Government having taken possession
of the ecclesiastical property, the officiating priests
are left to depend upon a stipend, in general barely
sufficient for their decent maintenance, so that there
is but small inducement left for men to devote
themselves to a life of celibacy.</p>

<p>But it is the trade and commerce of Buenos Ayres
which is the great source of occupation for its extensive
population; since, though the importing and
exporting part of the business may be chiefly carried
on by the foreign merchants, the details are for the
most part left to the natives: they collect, and
prepare, and bring in for sale, all the produce of the
country, and retail the goods imported from foreign
countries: nor is it thought at all degrading for
young men of the best connexions to stand behind
a counter: there they gossip with their fair customers
upon a perfect equality, and in dandyism a
Buenos Ayrean shopkeeper may be backed against
the smartest man-milliner of London or Paris.</p>

<p>The mechanics and artisans form also a large
class, as may be supposed, in a country where
everything is wanted, and no man feels inclined to
do much; it is in this line that the European has so
decided an advantage over the native from his more
industrious habits; for he requires no siesta, and
works whilst the natives of all classes, high and low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
are asleep: he cannot fail to prosper if he will but
avoid the drinking-shops; but he must be resolute
on that point, for it is a temptation which he finds
at the corner of every street: no less than 600 pulperias
are open in the city alone, as appears by the
list of licences annually taken out at the police<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>For everyone who will work there is employment,
and as to real <i>want</i>, it can hardly exist in a country
where beef is dear at a halfpenny a-pound, and where
the generality of the lower orders want nothing else.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

CITY OF BUENOS AYRES.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Great extent of the City. Public Buildings. Inconvenient Arrangement
and want of Comfort in the Dwellings of the Natives
a few years ago. Prejudice against Chimneys. Subsequent
Improvements introduced by Foreigners. Iron gratings at the
windows necessary. Water scarce and dear. That of the River
Plata excellent, and capable of being kept a very long time.
Pavement of Buenos Ayres.</p></div>


<p>Buenos Ayres, like all other cities in Spanish
America, is built upon the uniform plan<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> prescribed
I believe by the Council of the Indies, consisting of
straight streets, intersecting each other at right angles
every 150 yards; and, from the peculiar construction
of the houses, covers at least twice the ground which
would be required for any European city of the
same population.</p>

<p>With the exception of the churches, which, though
unfinished externally, exhibit in their interior all the
gaudy richness of the religion to which they belong,
and will be lasting memorials of the pious zeal of
the Jesuits, who built the greater part of them,
there is nothing remarkable in the style of the public
buildings. The old government considered
money laid out in beautifying the city as so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
thrown away upon the colonists, and the new government
has been as yet too poor to do more than
has been absolutely necessary; what has been done,
however, has been well done, and does credit to the
republican authorities.</p>

<p>In their private dwellings there was a wretched
want of every comfort, when I first went to the
country. With but few exceptions, they were confined
to a ground floor; the apartments built <i>en
suite</i>, without passages, round two or three successive
quadrangular courts, called patios, opening into
each other; and the whole distribution about as
primitive and inconvenient as can be imagined.</p>

<p>The floors of the best rooms were of bricks or
tiles, the rafters of the roof seldom hid by a ceiling,
the walls as cold as whitewash could make them;
whilst the furniture was of the most gaudy, tawdry,
North American manufacture: a few highly-coloured
French prints, serving, perhaps, to mark the state
of the fine arts in South America.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more anti-comfortable to English
eyes. In cold weather these cold-looking
rooms were heated by braziers, at the risk of choking
the inmates with the fumes of charcoal; chimneys,
so far from being looked upon as wholesome ventilators,
were regarded as certain conductors of wet and
cold; and it was not till long after the introduction
of them by the European residents had practically
proved their safety and superiority over the old
Spanish warming-pans, that the natives could be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>duced
to try them. The apprehension that they
increased the risk of fire was even without foundation,
for never were the habitations of man built of
such incombustible materials. The roofs and floors,
I have already said, are all of brick, and the few
beams which are necessary for supporting the former
are of a wood from Paraguay, as hard as teak, and
almost as incombustible as the bricks themselves.</p>

<p>Of the prejudices of the natives about chimneys I
may perhaps have rather a sensitive feeling, from a
practical experience I had myself upon the subject
soon after my landing amongst them. There was
but one in all the apartments I occupied with my
family, and that one my Spanish landlord, to my no
small dismay and astonishment, ordered a bricklayer
to stop up one afternoon over our heads, because
he had had a dispute with my servants about the
necessity of occasionally sweeping it, which he chose
to take this summary way of putting an end to.
The weather was wet and bad enough, and I never
was more in want of the comfort of a good fire;
but no entreaty or remonstrance could shake
the obstinate determination of the old Don. He
had the advantage of us by living over head, in the
upper apartments of the building; and he was determined
to make us fully sensible of the <i>de facto</i>
superiority of his authority. He required no chimney
himself, and he could not be made to understand
that a Spanish brazier would not answer all our
English wants just as well as it did his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>I lived, however, long enough in Buenos Ayres
to see great changes in these matters, and such
innovations upon the old habits and fashions of
the people as would make a stranger now doubt
whether it really be the place he may have read of.
In nothing is the alteration more striking than in
the comparative comfort, if not luxury, which has
found its way into the dwellings of the better classes:
thanks to the English and French upholsterers, who
have swarmed out to Buenos Ayres, the old whitewashed
walls have been covered with paper in all
the varieties from Paris; and European furniture
of every sort is to be met with in every house.
English grates, supplied with coals carried out from
Liverpool as ballast, and often sold at lower prices
than in London, have been brought into very general
use, and certainly have contributed to the health
and comfort of a city, the atmosphere of which is
nine days out of ten affected by the damps from the
river. Nor is the improvement confined to the internal
arrangement of the houses, a striking change
has taken place in the whole style of building in
Buenos Ayres. With the influx of strangers, the
value of property, especially in the more central
part of the city, has been greatly enhanced, and has
led the natives to think of economising their ground
by constructing upper stories to their houses in the
European fashion, the obvious advantage whereof
will no doubt ere many years make the plan general,
and greatly add to the embellishment of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Some peculiarities will probably long be preserved,
such amongst other as the iron gratings,
or rather railings, which protect the windows, and
which, on more than one occasion, have proved the
best safeguards of the inhabitants: it requires some
time for a European to become reconciled to their
appearance, which ill accords with the <i>beau-id&eacute;al</i>
of republican liberty and public safety; yet when
painted green they are rather ornamental than otherwise,
particularly when hung, as they frequently are,
with festoons of the beautiful air-plants of Paraguay,
which there live and blossom even on cold iron,
and one does get reconciled to them, I believe, from
a speedy conviction of their necessity in the present
state of society in those countries:&mdash;in the hot
nights of summer, too, it is some comfort to be
able to leave a window open without risk of intrusion;
though some of the light-fingered gentry
have made this not quite so safe as it used to be.
I have known more than one instance of a clever
thief running off with the clothes of the sleeping
inmates, fished through the gratings by means of
one of the long canes of the country, with a hook at
the end of it:&mdash;in one well-known case, a gentleman's
watch was thus hooked out of its pocket at
his bed's head, and he was but just roused by his
frightened wife in time to catch a last glimpse of
the chain and seals as they seemingly danced out of
the window.</p>

<p>It will hardly be credited that water is an expen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>sive
article within fifty yards of the Plata, but so it
is; nothing can be worse than the ordinary supply
of it. That obtained from the wells is brackish and
bad, and there are no public cisterns or reservoirs,
although the city is so slightly elevated above the
river, that nothing would be easier than to keep it
continually provided by the most ordinary artificial
means. As it is, those who can afford it go to a
great expense in constructing large tanks under the
pavement of their court-yards, into which the rainwater
collected from the flat-terraced roofs of their
houses is conducted by pipes; and in general a
sufficiency may thus be secured for the ordinary
purposes of the family; but the lower orders, who
cannot afford to go to such an expense, depend
for a more scanty supply upon the itinerant water-carriers,
who, at a certain time of day, are to
be seen lazily perambulating the streets with huge
butts filled at the river, mounted on the monstrous
cart-wheels of the country, and drawn by a yoke
of oxen; a clumsy and expensive contrivance altogether,
which makes even water dear within a
stone's throw of the largest river in the world.
Taken at the very edge, it is seldom of the purest,
and generally requires to stand twenty-four hours
before it deposits its muddy sediment, and becomes
sufficiently cleared to be drinkable; it is then excellent,
and may be kept for any time. I have
drunk it myself on board ship, after it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
two voyages to England and back, and never tasted
better.</p>

<p>The principal streets are now tolerably paved
with granite brought from the islands above Buenos
Ayres, especially from Martin Garcia. How the
people got about before they were paved it is difficult
to understand, for the streets must have been
at times one continued slough; at least if one may
judge from the state of those which are still unfinished,
and which, after any continuance of wet
weather, are nearly, if not entirely, impassable, even
for people on horseback, much more so for carriages.
I have seen in some of them the mire so deep that
the oxen could not drag the country carts through
it; and it not unfrequently happens, in such a case,
that the animals themselves are unable to get out,
and are left to die and rot in the swamp in the
middle of the street.</p>

<p>It was a fair sample of the miserable economy
and wretched policy of the colonial authorities, that
a commercial city of such importance, and in which
the traffic was daily increasing, should have been
allowed so long to remain in such a state, with an
inexhaustible supply of the best paving materials in
the world within twenty or thirty miles of it, and of
such easy water-carriage. The people however,
were led to believe that the difficulties and impediments
to such an improvement as the general paving
of the city were next to insurmountable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The Viceroy himself, the Marquis of Loreto,
when the first notion of such a plan was started,
gravely gave, amongst other reasons against it, the
danger of the houses falling down from the shaking
of their foundations, by the driving of heavy carts
over a stone pavement so close to them, whilst another
and still more weighty objection in his opinion
was, the necessity it would entail upon the people
to put iron tires to their cart-wheels, and to shoe
their horses, which, he reminded them, would cost
them more than the animals themselves. Fortunately,
his immediate successors, Aredondo and
Aviles, were not deterred by similar alarms. The
former commenced the work with activity about the
year 1795, with the aid of a subscription voluntarily
raised by the inhabitants; and the latter carried it
on to a much greater extent, levying a trifling duty
upon the city for the purpose, which was readily
submitted to, when, as the work advanced, the improvement
became manifest. In later times, especially
during the government of 1822-24, much
more was done, and there are few of the principal
streets which are not now more or less completed.</p>

<p>The granite is excellent, and was carefully examined
in situ by Mr. Bevans, an English engineer,
a few years ago, who reported that it was easy to
be worked, and the supply inexhaustible. When
the working of it is better understood by the natives,
it will probably be brought into much more general
use.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

CLIMATE OF BUENOS AYRES, AND ITS EFFECTS.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Climate of Buenos Ayres, liable to sudden changes. Influence of
the North Wind. Case of Garcia. Effects of a Pampero. Dust-Storms
and Showers of Mud. The Natives free from Epidemics,
but liable to peculiar affections from the state of the
atmosphere. Lockjaw of very common occurrence. The Smallpox
stopped by Vaccination. Introduced in 1805, and preserved
by an individual. Its first introduction amongst the
Native Indians by General Rosas. Cases of Longevity, of
frequent occurrence.</p></div>


<p>Azara, the best of all writers upon the country,
has with much truth observed that the climate of
Buenos Ayres is governed not so much by its latitude
as by the wind, a change of which will continually
produce an alteration of from 20 to 30
degrees in the thermometer<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>?</p>

<p>I have been often asked whether the heats in
summer are not almost intolerable. On some days
they are so; the glass perhaps above 90&deg; in the shade,
and all nature gasping for air; but on those very days
the most experienced of the natives will be clothed
in warm woollens instead of linen jackets and
trousers, for fear of catching cold.</p>

<p>During the greater part of the year the prevailing
winds are northerly, which, passing over the marshy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
lands of Entre Rios, and then over the wide expanse
of the Plata, imbibe their exhalations, and, by
the time they reach the southern shores of the river,
have a great influence upon the climate. Everything
is damp: the mould stands upon the boots
cleaned but yesterday; books become mildewed, and
the keys rust in one's pocket. Good fires are the
best preservatives, and I found them, if not absolutely
necessary, at least very comfortable, during
quite as many months as I should have had them in
England; and yet I never, during nine years, saw
snow, or ice thicker than a dollar, and the latter
only once. Upon the bodily system the effect produced
by this prevailing humidity is a general lassitude
and relaxation; opening the pores of the skin,
and inducing great liability to colds, sore throats,
rheumatic affections, and all the consequences of
checked perspiration; one of the best safeguards
against which is doubtless the woollen clothing of
the natives, of which I have already spoken; though
they require it, perhaps, the more especially, because
they seldom stir out of their houses in the
extreme heat of the day; and it is at the time
they do go out, when the sun has lost its power
and the damps of evening are setting in, that such
precautions are doubly necessary. Europeans, at
first, are loth to take the same care of themselves,
but sooner or later they discover that the natives are
right, and insensibly fall into their ways.</p>

<p>The evil effects of all this humidity, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
they are dangerous, appear to be confined to the
immediate vicinity of the river, and to the inhabitants
of the city; for in the pampas the gauchos
sleep upon the ground during the greater part of
the year in the open air without risk. Their skins,
however, like those of the cattle they watch, are
probably impervious to the wet.</p>

<p>Before I went to Buenos Ayres I had suffered
much from malaria fever, caught in Greece; and
when I saw, for the first time, the low, flat, marshy
appearance of the whole country, I expected nothing
less than a return of my old ague. Everything
around seemed to bespeak it: but Buenos Ayres is
free from such disorders, and cases of intermittent
fever, such as that I speak of, are rarely known there.</p>

<p>Still, though free from the malaria of the Mediterranean
coasts, the sirocco of the Levant does not
bring with it more disagreeable affections than the
viento norte, or north wind of Buenos Ayres; indeed,
the irritability and ill-humours it excites in
some people amount to little less than a temporary
derangement of their moral faculties: it is a common
thing to see men amongst the better classes shut
themselves up in their houses during its continuance,
and lay aside all business till it has passed;
whilst amongst the lower orders it is a fact well
known to the police that cases of quarrelling and
bloodshed are infinitely more frequent during the
north wind than at any other time. In illustration
of this, I shall quote a case in point, the account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of which I received from one of the most eminent
medical men in the country, who had paid particular
attention during a practice of more than thirty
years to its influence upon the human system.</p>

<p>In the year &mdash;&mdash; a man named Garcia was executed
for murder. He was a person of some education,
esteemed by those who knew him, and, in
general, rather remarkable than otherwise for the
civility and amenity of his manners; his countenance
was open and handsome, and his disposition
frank and generous; but when the north wind set in
he appeared to lose all command of himself, and such
was his extreme irritability, that during its continuance
he could hardly speak to any one in the street
without quarrelling. In a conversation with my informant
a few hours before his execution, he admitted
that it was the third murder he had been guilty
of besides having been engaged in more than twenty
fights with knives, in which he had both given and
received many serious wounds; but, he observed, it
was the north wind, not he, that shed all this blood.
When he rose from his bed in the morning, he said,
he was at once aware of its accursed influence upon
him;&mdash;a dull headache first, and then a feeling of
impatience at everything about him, would cause
him to take umbrage even at the members of his
own family on the most trivial occurrence. If he
went abroad his headache generally became worse,
a heavy weight seemed to hang over his temples, he
saw objects, as it were, through a cloud, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
hardly conscious where he went. He was fond of
play, and if in such a mood a gambling-house was
in his way he seldom resisted the temptation; once
there, any turn of ill-luck would so irritate him,
that the chances were he would insult some of the
by-standers. Those who knew him, perhaps, would
bear with his ill-humours, but, if unhappily he
chanced to meet with a stranger disposed to resent
his abuse, they seldom parted without bloodshed.
Such was the account the wretched man gave of
himself, and it was corroborated afterwards by his
relations and friends, who added, that no sooner had
the cause of his excitement passed away than he
would deplore his weakness, and never rested till he
had sought out and made his peace with those whom
he had hurt or offended.</p>

<p>Europeans, though often sensible of its influence,
are not in general so liable to be affected by
this abominable wind as the natives, amongst whom
the women appear to be the greatest sufferers, especially
from the headache it occasions. Numbers of
them may be seen at times in the streets, walking
about with large split-beans stuck upon their temples;
a sure sign which way the wind blows. The
bean, which is applied raw, appears to act as a
slight blister, and to counteract the relaxation caused
by the state of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>But it is not the human constitution alone that is
affected; the discomforts of the day are generally
increased by the derangement of most of the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>hold
preparations:&mdash;The meat turns putrid, the milk
curdles, and even the bread which is baked whilst
it lasts is frequently bad. Every one complains,
and the only answer returned is&mdash;"<i>Se&ntilde;or, es el
viento norte.</i>"</p>

<p>All these miseries, however, are not without their
remedy; when the sufferings of the natives are at
their climax, the mercury will give the sure indication
of a coming pampero, as the south-wester is
called; on a sudden, a rustling breeze breaks
through the stillness of the stagnant atmosphere,
and in a few seconds sweeps away the incubus and
all else before it; originating in the snows of the
Andes, the blast rushes with unbroken violence over
the intermediate pampas, and, ere it reaches Buenos
Ayres, becomes often a hurricane.</p>

<p>A very different state of things then takes place,
and, from the suddenness of such changes, the most
ludicrous, though often serious, accidents occur, particularly
in the river; whither, of an evening especially,
a great part of the population will resort to
cool themselves during the hot weather. There
they may be seen, hundreds and hundreds of men,
women, and children, sitting together up to their
necks in the water, just like so many frogs in a
marsh: if a pampero breaks, as it often does, unexpectedly
upon such an assembly, the scramble and
confusion which ensues is better imagined than told;
fortunate are those who may have taken an attendant
to watch their clothes, for otherwise, long ere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
they can get out of the river, every article of dress
is flying before the gale.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently the pampero is accompanied by
clouds of dust from the parched pampas, so dense
as to produce total darkness, in which I have known
instances of bathers in the river being drowned ere
they could find their way to the shore. I recollect
on one of these occasions, a gang of twenty convicts,
who were working at the time in irons upon the
beach, making their escape in the dark, not one of
whom, I believe, was retaken.</p>

<p>It is difficult to convey any idea of the strange
effects of these dust-storms: day is changed to night,
and nothing can exceed the temporary darkness produced
by them, which I have known to last for a
quarter of an hour in the middle of the day; very
frequently they are laid by a heavy fall of rain,
which, mingling with the clouds of dust as it pours
down, forms literally a shower of mud<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. The sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of dirty pickle in which people appear after being
caught in such a storm is indescribable.</p>

<p>Sometimes the consequences are more serious,
and the pampero is accompanied by the most terrific
thunder and lightning; such, I believe as is to be
witnessed in no other part of the world, unless it be
the Straits of Sunda. Nothing can be more appalling.
In Azara may be read an account of nineteen
persons killed by the lightning which fell in the
city during one of these storms.</p>

<p>But the atmosphere is effectually cleared; man
breathes once more, and all nature seems to revive
under the exhilarating freshness of the gale:&mdash;the
natives, good-humoured and thoughtless, laugh over
the less serious consequences, and soon forget the
worst; happy in the belief that, at any rate, they are
free from the epidemical disorders of other regions.</p>

<p>Still such variations from the ordinary courses
of nature cannot but be productive of strange consequences;
and, though the transient effects of an overcharged
atmosphere may be quickly dispelled by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>pampero, and the people be really free from the epidemics
of other countries, there is every reason to
believe that, in this particular climate, the human
system is in a high degree susceptible of affections
which elsewhere would not be deemed worth a moment's
consideration. Besides those I have already
spoken of as arising from the north wind, old wounds
are found to burst out afresh, new ones are very difficult
to heal; an apparently trivial sprain will induce
a weakness of the part requiring years perhaps to
recover from, as I know from my own experience;
and lock-jaw from the most trifling accidents is so
common as to constitute the cause of a very great
portion of the deaths from hurts in the public hospitals.
A cut thumb, a nail run into the hand or
foot, a lacerated muscle, will generally terminate in
it; and our own medical men well know how great
a proportion of our wounded in the attack of 1806
and 1807 died from this dreadful cause. The native
practitioners attribute its frequent occurrence to
some peculiarity in the atmosphere acting upon the
system in a manner they are as yet unable to explain.
Under the name of the "mal de siete dias" (the
seven days' sickness), a vast number of children
are carried off by it in the first week of their existence;
but, as this mortality is principally limited to
the lower orders, it may perhaps in most cases be
traced to mismanagement and neglect. With us,
the long confinement of the mother ensures the same
care of the infant in the first weeks of its life; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in a country where the mother leaves her bed in two
or three days to return to her work, the child must
often be neglected. Many a Buenos Ayrean washerwoman
may be seen at her usual work at the riverside
three or four days after her delivery, with her
infant lying for the greater part of the day upon a
piece of cold hide, beside her on the damp ground.
Can any one wonder that it takes cold and dies?
There was a time, and but few years ago, when it
was gravely asserted that the mortality amongst
infants arose from their being baptized with cold
water, and the authorities, concurring in the notion,
actually issued a decree that none but warm water
should be used for such purposes in the churches.
I believe, however, that the deaths were not found to
diminish, and that the priests are again permitted to
use cold water as before, though I doubt the enactment
to the contrary having ever been repealed; but
why should these cases so generally terminate in
lock-jaw<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>?</p>

<p>The dreadful ravages occasioned formerly by the
small-pox have latterly been in a great measure
arrested amongst the civilised portion of the inhabitants
by the general use of vaccination: accidentally
conveyed to Buenos Ayres in 1805 by the
owner of a cargo of slaves, it was preserved by the
patriotic zeal of an enlightened priest, Dr. Segurola,
who, deeply impressed with its immense importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
voluntarily devoted himself to the task of propagating
it amongst his countrymen, especially the
poor, whose ignorant prejudices he had often to
combat, and whom he was not unfrequently obliged
to bribe to submit to the operation. For sixteen
years he laboured incessantly in this vocation, at the
expiration of which, he had the satisfaction of finding
his single exertions no longer adequate to satisfy
the general demand for it. The Government then
(in 1822) relieved him of his charge, and instituted
a proper establishment for the express purpose
of propagating vaccination gratis, not only in
the city of Buenos Ayres, but throughout the republic;
others were afterwards added in the several
country districts, from which the lymph is now distributed
to all who apply for it, and has been sent
into every province of the interior. The authorities
make it compulsory, as far as they can, on parents
to carry their children to these establishments; and
the parochial priests are charged to see that they
do so.</p>

<p>By a report published in 1829 upon this subject,
it appeared that in the city alone, in the previous
nine months, as many as 4160 children had been
vaccinated; a large proportion to the births, which
are estimated at little more than 6000 yearly. I
was more than once applied to for it from Rio
de Janeiro, whither it was always most readily forwarded
by the Buenos Ayrean administrators.</p>

<p>But the destruction created by the small-pox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
amongst the Spaniards was nothing when compared
to its dreadful consequences amongst the native
Indians. Whole tribes have been swept away by it:
I believe, nations&mdash;whose languages have been lost.
The plague is not more a frightful scourge than this
disorder, when it attacks the miserable inhabitants
of the pampas: they themselves believe it to be incurable,
a feeling which adds to its lamentable consequences,
for no sooner does it appear than their tents
are raised, and the whole tribe takes to flight, abandoning
the unfortunate sufferers to the certainty of
perishing of hunger and thirst, if the virulence of
the disorder itself does not first carry them off.</p>

<p>An opportunity, however, offered during the time
I was at Buenos Ayres of making known to these
poor people, also, the effects of vaccination, under
circumstances which it is to be hoped may eventually
lead to its diffusion amongst them, as well as their
more civilised neighbours.</p>

<p>A large party of some of the friendly tribes, with
their wives and children, repaired to the city on a visit
of duty to the Governor, General Rosas, and had not
been there long when some of them were attacked
with small-pox, amongst the rest, one of their principal
Caciques. As usual, the sufferers were immediately
abandoned by their own relatives, and might
have died like dogs, had not their more civilised
friends taken charge of them, for which the poor
wretches were abundantly grateful; but their surprise
was without bounds, when the Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
himself, who had a regard for the old Chief, went in
person to visit him. General Rosas did not fail to
remark the strong impression created by his visit,
and saw at once the advantage to which it might
be turned. Ordering the astonished Indians to be
brought before him, he showed them the mark upon
his own arm, and fully explained to them the nature
of the secret which had enabled him to visit their
dying Cacique with impunity. The result was, that
nearly 150 of them, including some of their Caciques,
Catrieu, Cachul, Tetru&eacute;, Quindul&eacute;, Callinao, Toriano,
and Venancio, with their wives and children,
were vaccinated on the spot at their own earnest solicitation;
and great was their childish delight on
finding, in due time, the appearance of the disorder
upon their arms, which they were fully satisfied
would prove an infallible charm against the worst
powers of the Evil one.</p>

<p>The impression created by this interesting occurrence
will not be easily effaced, and, although subsequent
events may have unfortunately delayed for a
time the further propagation of this inestimable blessing
amongst the Indians, I have little doubt that it
will again be sought for; and who can say that, with
good management, it may not be converted into a
means of domiciliating and reducing to Christianity
the remnants of a race, who, in their turn, might
repay with productive labour their benefactors a
hundred fold?</p>

<p>I must not close this chapter without adding that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
notwithstanding what I have said as to the effects of
the climate upon some constitutions, the people in
general live to a good old age in perfect enjoyment
of their mental as well as bodily faculties; and that
instances of longevity are common, the following
extracts from the several population returns will
sufficiently prove:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the census of 1778, 33 cases are quoted of
individuals then living in the city, aged from 90 to
100; and 17 of from 100 to 112."</p>

<p>In the tables of mortality for 1823 and 1824, 58
persons are said to have died between the ages of
90 and 100; 6 between 100 and 110; 3 between
112 and 116; 1 of 128, and another of 130. The
two last were females.</p>

"Yesterday we had another of those awful dust-storms which

whole population; in an instant, as it were, there was a transition

thunder was by no means distant. After eleven minutes and a

the effect upon the white walls of making them appear, when the sun
again showed itself, as if they had been stained or sprinkled with ink.
I never witnessed a more majestic or awful phenomenon. The consternation
was general; every one rushing into the nearest house,

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

HISTORY OF THE SPANISH SETTLEMENTS ON THE COAST OF
PATAGONIA.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Little known of Patagonia till the appearance of Falkner's work in
1774. It stimulates the Spanish Government to send out an
expedition under Piedra in 1778, to form settlements upon the
coast. He discovers the Bay of San Joseph's. Francisco
Viedma forms a settlement on the River Negro. Antonio, his
brother, explores the southern part of the coast, and forms another
at San Julian's. His account of the Indians he found there.
The New Settlements abandoned in 1783, with the exception of
that on the River Negro. Villari&ntilde;o ascends that river, as far as
the Cordillera opposite Valdivia. A dispute with the Araucanian
Indians prevents his communication with the Spaniards of
Chile, and obliges him to return. Piedra succeeds Viedma,
attacks the Pampa Tribes, and is defeated. Don Ortiz de Rosas,
father of the present Governor of Buenos Ayres, is taken prisoner
by them, and succeeds in bringing about a general pacification.
Subsequent neglect of the settlement on the Rio
Negro. Its population in 1825, and coasting-trade with Buenos
Ayres.</p></div>


<p>Before they became independent of Spain, and
whilst the people of Buenos Ayres possessed in the
Banda Oriental more waste lands than they wanted,
safe from any incursions of the Indians, and better
adapted perhaps than any other in South America
for the rearing of cattle, at that time their only
object, they had no particular inducement to extend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
their possessions further than the River Salado; all
beyond was left to the Indians, and little or nothing
was known of their country, except what they chose
to communicate, until Falkner published his account
of Patagonia in a country town in England in 1774.
The appearance of that book produced results which
the author perhaps little anticipated, for it stimulated
the Spanish Government to make a general survey
of the coast of Patagonia, and to form settlements
upon it, the history of which to this day has never yet
been made public. It is of those measures, and the
information derived from them, that I purpose to
give some account in this chapter.</p>

<p>Father Falkner, the author above alluded to, was
an Englishman, who, from a very early age, seems
to have had a passion for travelling. Brought up to
the medical profession, he went in the capacity of
a surgeon on board a trading-vessel to Cadiz, where
he embarked in one of the Assiento ships, bound on
a slaving voyage, eventually to Buenos Ayres: there
he was induced to enter the order of Jesuits, in
which, as a missionary, he afterwards made himself
conspicuous for the zeal with which he devoted himself
to the conversion of the Indian inhabitants of
the unexplored regions of that part of the world.
Forty years he passed amongst them, and, but for
the expulsion of his order from South America, he
would probably have ended his days there. On his
return to England, he wrote his book, to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
day the only authentic account we have of the
manners and customs of the Indians of the pampas,
whilst the map it contains, compiled partly from his
own observations, and partly from Indian accounts,
has furnished the principal, if not the sole data for
all those which have since been published of the interior
of their country.</p>

<p>One of his principal objects avowedly was to
point out how vulnerable by any hostile naval
power were the Spanish possessions in those parts;
and hardly had the book appeared when the Spanish
Government, taking alarm lest his suggestions
should be listened to in England, sent secret orders
to the Viceroy of Buenos Ayres to have the whole
coast of Patagonia carefully surveyed, with a view
"to the formation of such new settlements upon it
as might secure the King of Spain's rights, and
forestall the English in their supposed intention of
appropriating to themselves the valuable fisheries on
the southern part of the coast."</p>

<p>Competent officers were sent out from Spain for
the purpose, and no expense was spared to execute
the survey as completely as possible. The command
was intrusted to Don Juan de la Piedra, who sailed
from Monte Video on this service on the 15th December,
1778.</p>

<p>Running down the coast, on the 7th January he
entered the great bay, then called Bahia Sin-fondo,
or San Matthias' Bay, but now more generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
known under the name of San Antonio, at the
bottom of which, in latitude 42&deg; 13&acute;, he discovered
the entrance of a noble harbour, which he named
San Joseph's.</p>

<p>Piedra passed three months in examining the
shores of this great gulf and the peninsula which
bounds it, and so impressed was he with its capabilities
that, without proceeding further, he left an
officer and part of his men to build a fort there, and
returned himself to the River Plate to give an
account of his discovery.</p>

<p>According to his report, indeed, it appeared on
many grounds to offer a most eligible site for a new
settlement. The port itself was said to be deep
and commodious, affording anchorage for ships of
any size, whilst its situation seemed particularly convenient
not only for facilitating the further exploration
of the great rivers Negro and Colorado, which
empty themselves a little to the northward of it, but
for securing more or less the entrance of those rivers
against any sudden surprise by the enemies of Spain,
a point to which great importance was attached in
the instructions of the surveying officers, in consequence
of the statements made by Falkner as to
the possibility of passing up them into the very heart
of the Spanish possessions.</p>

<p>The vast number of whales and seals which were
seen in its neighbourhood, moreover, held out the
promise of its becoming a station whence to carry on
those fisheries which the Spanish Government of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
day were so anxious to establish<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>; whilst the extensive
salt deposits in several parts of the peninsula
promised an inexhaustible supply of an article of the
first necessity in Buenos Ayres in curing the hides
and beef.</p>

<p>The only drawback to the situation was the
apparent scarcity of fresh water, which the discoverers
had great difficulty in finding in the first
instance, though subsequently a sufficiency was obtained
at some distance from the coast: it was, however,
at all times more or less brackish, and eventually
caused much sickness and suffering to the
settlers.</p>

<p>The Viceroy was dissatisfied with Piedra for returning,
and superseded him, when it devolved upon
Don Francisco and Antonio Viedma (the officers
next in command of those sent out from Spain) to
carry into execution the intentions of their Government.
These brothers were long employed upon
various parts of the coast of Patagonia, and collected
much valuable information respecting that <i>terra incognita</i>.</p>

<p>In April, 1779, Don Francisco sailed from San
Joseph's, to form a settlement on the River Negro,
in favour of which he was fortunate enough to propitiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the Viceroy, who supplied him with men and
stores, and all things necessary for the purpose.</p>

<p>Don Antonio was left in charge at San Joseph's;
but, the scurvy breaking out amongst the people to a
great extent, they became so dissatisfied that he was
under the necessity in the course of the summer of
returning with the greater part of them to Monte
Video. He was not, however, permitted to be long
idle; and in the January following (1780) was
again despatched to carry out the original plan, and
to survey the whole of the southern part of the
coast of Patagonia.</p>

<p>In furtherance of these orders, he examined the
several ports of St. Helena, San Gregorio, the
northern shores of the great Bay of San George,
Port Desire, and San Julian's: which occupied
him till the end of May, when, the cold weather
setting in, he hutted his people for the winter at
Port Desire, and despatched one of his vessels to
Buenos Ayres with an account of his proceedings.</p>

<p>Of all the places he had visited, San Julian's appeared
to offer the best, if not the only suitable site
for any permanent establishment. Everywhere else,
the coast presented the aspect of sandy, steril dunes,
intermixed with stones and gravel, fit only, to all
appearance, for the occupation of the wild guanacoes
and ostriches, which wandered over them in
quest of the scanty coarse grass which constituted
their only herbage. No wood was to be seen bigger
than a small species of thorny shrub, fit only for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
purposes of fuel; and, as to water, it was every
where scarce, and the little to be found was generally
brackish and bad. The ports, too, were most
of them difficult and dangerous of access, affording
little or no security for vessels above the size of a brig.</p>

<p>San Julian's was so far an exception, that at high
tide the largest ships might enter and lay safely at
anchor within the bar off its mouth. A constant
supply of water, too, was found three or four miles
inland, proceeding from some springs in the hills,
about which there was good pasturage, and enough of
it to have induced a considerable tribe of Indians to
fix upon it as their ordinary dwelling-place. There,
also, Viedma proposed to plant a little colony;
and, the Viceroy approving the plan, the people
were removed from Port Desire in the month of
November, and commenced building their habitations
in the vicinity of the springs above mentioned,
about a league from the coast. They received the
materials, and a variety of necessary supplies, from
Buenos Ayres, not the least useful of which were
some carts and about twenty draught-horses, which
enabled them afterwards to keep up a constant communication
between the shore and their little settlement.</p>

<p>They found the Indians extremely well disposed,
and ready to render them every assistance in their
power, in return for the trifling presents they made
them. Altogether there might be about 400 of
them, and about half as many more were encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
upon the Santa Cruz River further south. These
were apparently the only inhabitants of those regions.
They said that in their journeys northward they fell
in with no other toldos or encampments till they
came to a river twenty-five days off; there were
some more two days beyond again upon a second
river, and thence it was twenty days further to the
toldos of the Indians of Tuca-malal, on the river
called by Villari&ntilde;o the Encarnacion, which falls into
the great River Negro; altogether, according to their
computation, something less than fifty days' travel
from San Julian's<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. To those parts they were in the
habit of occasionally repairing in order to buy fresh
horses from the tribes there resident, who they said
had plenty of them, and exchanged them for the
guanaco skins which they took from the more southern
part of the country. They caught those animals
with their bolas and lassoes, and often supplied the
colonists with fresh meat when they had no means
of their own of obtaining it.</p>

<p>This assistance was of the greater value to them,
as the winter set in with a severity, against which
they were very indifferently prepared. The months
of June, July, and August were piercingly cold,
much snow fell, and the people, unused to such a
climate, became very sickly, and many of them died.
Viedma himself was so ill as to be some time confined
to his bed; nor was it till the return of spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that the survivors began to recover their strength,
and were able to go on with the works. They got
through the subsequent winter better, after their
houses were completed, and they were able to collect
some necessary comforts about them. The vegetables
they planted throve well, and in the second February
they gathered in their first harvest, which
yielded a fair crop in proportion to the corn sown.
The brushwood in the surrounding country was
sufficient to supply them with fuel, but there was
no timber fit for building, of which they were
daily in want; and in quest of this Viedma was induced
to make an excursion into the interior by the
Indians, who asserted that an abundance was to be
had near the source of the Santa Cruz river, which
they said was a great lake at the foot of the Cordillera,
whither they offered to guide him.</p>

<p>On this expedition he left San Julian's early in
November (1782), with some of his own people,
and a party of the Indians under their cacique.
Proceeding westward, and inclining to the south,
over hills and dales, at a distance of about twenty-five
leagues they reached the Rio Chico, or little
river, which the Indians said fell into the harbour of
Santa Cruz. There was at that time no difficulty
in fording it, the water not being much above their
saddle-girths, and its width not above fifty yards,
though, from the appearance of its steep and water-worn
banks, it was evidently a much more considerable
stream during the season of the floods. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Indians said it was the drain of a lake far in the
north-west, formed by the melting of the snows in
the Cordillera.</p>

<p>So far, wherever they halted, they had found no
lack of pasturage for their horses, or water, or
brushwood for fuel; but after crossing the Chico
the country became more rocky and barren: fourteen
leagues beyond the Chico they came to a
much more considerable river, called the Chalia
by the Indians, who described it as issuing from
another lake in the mountains, between the sources
of the Rio Chico and those of the great river of
Santa Cruz, which it joined, they said, further on.
They found it too deep to cross where they first
reached it, and were obliged in consequence to follow
its course upwards for eight leagues, over a stony,
rugged country, which lamed all their horses, and
the desolate appearance of which was increased by
the visitation of a flight of locusts which had devoured
all the vegetation for three leagues. They
crossed it, at last, at a place called Quesanexes by
their Indian guides, from a remarkable rock standing
out like a tower from the rocky, rugged cliffs
which there bounded the bed of the river (some
basaltic formation probably).</p>

<p>On looking at the sketch, in the seventh volume of
the "Journal of the Geographical Society," of Captain
FitzRoy's Survey of the river Santa Cruz, it appears
probable that the Chalia is the stream which runs
into it from <i>basalt glen</i>, and which, though a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
inconsiderable one at the season he passed by it,
was manifestly one of much more importance at
other times.</p>

<p>Eight leagues after crossing the Chalia they came
to the great lake under the Cordillera, which the
Indians had talked of as the origin of the Santa
Cruz River.</p>

<p>Viedma describes it as of great extent, situated in
a sort of bay, or vast amphitheatre of the mountains,
from the steep ravines of which ran down
the many streams which filled it, chiefly derived
from the melting of the snows in the north-west:
he skirted it for twelve leagues to its extremity
in that direction, and estimated its extreme length at
about fourteen; its width, he says, might be from
four to five leagues. Some dark patches amongst
the snow on the distant heights indicated the clumps
of trees of which the Indians had spoken; but the
few which Viedma was able to examine were not
what he had been led to expect; he speaks of them
as resembling a wild cherry, with a fruit in appearance
not unlike it, though of a more orange colour,
and without a stone and very tasteless; the wood
stunted, and so crooked as to be entirely unfit for
anything but burning. May it not have been the
crab-apple? We know there are plenty of apples
further north in the same range.</p>

<p>Describing the appearance of the Cordillera from
the head of the lake, he says, towards the north
it looked like a vast table-land stretching from east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to west; but it had a different appearance in the
south, breaking into steep and broken peaks, for the
most part covered with snow. The Indians said
that neither to the north nor south was the main
chain passable by man or beast for a very long distance.
They all concurred in stating that a large
river issued from the south-east angle of the lake,
which they believed to be the great river of Santa
Cruz<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; Viedma, unfortunately, was not able to
examine it, as he wished, in consequence of the
apparent swelling of the mountain-torrents, which
alarmed the Indians lest they should so increase the
rivers as to prevent their recrossing them on their
return; nor were they very wrong, for, by the time
they got back to the Chico, they found it a wide and
rapid stream no longer fordable.</p>

<p>It was proposed that some of the Indians who
could swim should tow Viedma across on a balsa,
which they set to work to construct of hides and
sticks, but when completed, it looked so frail and
dangerous a ferry, that the Spaniards preferred running
the risk of swimming their horses over. This
they accomplished without accident, and reached
San Julian's in safety again on the 3rd of December,
after nearly a month's absence, during which
they were much indebted to the Indians for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
friendly aid, and knowledge of the country through
which they passed.</p>

<p>The people of this tribe, who had never seen
a Spaniard before, Viedma describes as of large
stature, generally above six feet high, and very
stout and fleshy; their faces broad, but of good expression,
and their complexion rather sunburnt than
naturally dark. Their skin cloaks, worn very
long, and reaching when on foot to their heels, gave
them an appearance of greater height than the
reality. Their habits and customs, according to his
account, seem to differ little from those of the
Pampa tribes, of which I shall elsewhere have
to speak. The men employed themselves in hunting
guanacoes and other animals for their skins, and
for meat to eat, whilst the women performed all the
domestic offices and drudgery of the household, such
as it was; but the good disposition uniformly shown
by them gave Viedma a most favourable opinion of
them, forming, as it did, a striking contrast with the
character of the tribes further north.</p>

<p>Shortly after this excursion (in April, 1783)
Don Antonio, considering his little colony as fairly
planted, proceeded to Buenos Ayres for the recovery
of his health. There the mortification awaited him
of learning that all his labour had been thrown away,
and that the Government of Spain had resolved to
break up the Patagonian settlements. The fact was,
that the great trouble and expense already incurred,
from the necessity of supplying all their first wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
from Buenos Ayres; the grumbling and complaints
of the settlers themselves, of the hardships they had
to go through, and of the inclemency of a climate
to which they were unaccustomed (which, joined to
the bad quality of their salt provisions, had certainly
produced scurvy amongst them to a frightful extent),
had all tended to create so unfavourable an
impression upon the Viceroy, that he had been led
to express a strong opinion to his Government as
to their worse than uselessness. The consequence
was, that after three or four years, in which upwards
of a million of hard dollars was spent upon
them, orders were sent out to abandon them all, except
the settlement upon the Rio Negro, after setting
up at San Joseph's, Port Desire, and San Julian's,
signals of possession, as the English had done at
Port Egmont, for evidence in case of need, of his
Catholic Majesty's rights<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>Don Antonio Viedma, who took a lively interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in the settlement he had formed at San Julian's, in
vain raised his voice against this determination, and
endeavoured to show that the grievances of the
settlers were but the natural difficulties to be expected
in the infancy of all new colonies; that they
knew the worst of them, and many of their remedies;
that a further experience of the seasons had shown
that the lands, so far from being unfit for cultivation,
as amongst other things was alleged, were quite
sufficiently productive to support them in after-years
without further aid from Buenos Ayres; and as to
the expenses, the heaviest were already incurred;
whilst the fisheries alone promised sources of wealth
and revenue to the mother country, as well as to the
neighbouring viceroyalty. But these arguments met
with little attention, and came too late to alter the
determination of the higher powers.</p>

<p>The same jealous policy which led the Spanish
Government to cause the coast of Patagonia to be
surveyed, equally influenced them in withholding
from publication the results, which remained carefully
hid from all inspection in the archives of the
Viceroyalty, though I cannot but think, had the
reports even of Viedma himself been given to the
world, they would have been the best possible security
to his Catholic Majesty against the curiosity
or encroachments of foreign nations. Not only did
they all tend to show that the coast itself was full of
dangers, but they also proved that the interior of
the land was, throughout, a steril and desolate waste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
scarce of water and vegetation: a region fit enough
for the wild beasts which had possession of it, but
very little adapted for the supply of any of the wants
of man. I cannot conceive what temptations such
possessions could possibly have offered to any European
power whatever, nor can it, I think, create
surprise that Spain herself abandoned them.</p>

<p>With respect to the fisheries, had there been any
real spirit of enterprise in the people of Monte Video
and Buenos Ayres, they might have monopolized
them; but no such spirit existed, and they were
suffered to fall into the hands of the more adventurous
sailors of England, North America, and
France. They equally neglected the importation of
salt, though a more necessary article to them, perhaps,
could hardly have been placed within their
reach; and after Viedma's voyage it was well known
that any quantity of it, of an excellent quality,
could be obtained either at San Joseph's, Port Desire,
or San Julian's. All that was necessary was
to collect it at the proper season, in the months of
January, February, and March, when it is hard and
dry, and consequently in the fittest state for shipping.</p>

<p>Dean Funes, the historian of Buenos Ayres,
writing on this subject, cannot suppress his indignation
at the apathy of his countrymen, though he
attempts, at the same time, to find an excuse for it
in an observation of Humboldt's with a simplicity
quite worth quoting. He says&mdash;"Who doubts that
the Spaniards of South America might have carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
on these fisheries at infinitely less cost than the
English and North Americans, when their own
coasts of Patagonia and round Cape Horn are known
to abound in whales, even in the harbours, by all accounts?
But it was not the cost, neither was it the
want of hands, which caused this important object
to remain neglected. It was the natural indolence
of the people and indifference of the Government.
How, indeed, was it possible," he adds, "to find men
to follow the hard profession of the sea, amongst a
people who prefer a hunch of beef to all the comforts
of life? 'The hope of gain,' Baron Humboldt
observes, 'is too weak a stimulus in a climate where
bounteous nature offers man a thousand ways of
obtaining a comfortable subsistence without the necessity
of leaving his native home to go to fight with
the monsters of the deep.'"</p>

<p>The Dean was a wise old man, who knew the
character of his countrymen thoroughly. Nor are
his observations confined to the Spaniards of South
America. Speaking of the ill-success of a company
in Spain to which the king, in 1790, had conceded
extraordinary privileges, as an encouragement to
carry on these fisheries, he says&mdash;"Its continual
losses, up to the period of its final failure, lead us to
the conclusion, that projects depending upon intelligence,
economy, and activity, are not made for a
people notoriously behindhand in information, and
habitually extravagant and lazy."</p>

<p>Whilst Don Antonio was occupied at San Julian's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
his brother, Don Francisco, was with no less zeal
laying the foundations of the settlement upon the
Rio Negro, the only one, as it appeared, of these
new establishments which was destined to be maintained.</p>

<p>It certainly possessed many advantages over the
more southern parts of the coast which had been
explored. It was not, like San Julian's, a thousand
miles distant from the governing authorities. Succours
in case of need could be sent to it by land as
well as by sea from Buenos Ayres; and this consideration
alone obviated the strongest objections made
by the poorer classes to settling themselves permanently
on other parts of the coast. The river itself
was not only a safeguard against the Indians, but
fertilized the adjoining lands, and insured to the
colonists a never-failing supply of fresh water, the
want of which had caused perhaps the greatest part
of their sufferings at the other places.</p>

<p>There were also other motives which operated
more powerfully than these in determining the
Spanish Government to maintain a settlement upon
the River Negro.</p>

<p>It was by proceeding up this river that Falkner
supposed a hostile naval power might surprise the
Spanish territories in the interior and in Chile&mdash;a
notion founded upon the concurrent accounts given
him by the Indians of the possibility of ascending it
as far as the Cordillera, and even to Mendoza. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
these accounts were to be depended upon, and such
a communication were really practicable between the
shores of the Atlantic and the provinces of Chile,
and Cuyo, it was impossible to foresee to what important
consequences it might lead, and how valuable
(independently of its advantages as a military position)
might become a settlement which would necessarily
be the key of that communication.</p>

<p>To determine a point of so much interest, in a
geographical as well as political point of view, was
therefore one of the first objects after the first settlers
were fairly established; and an expedition was prepared
to explore the river to its sources, and to
examine its principal affluents. The command was
intrusted to Don Basilio Villari&ntilde;o, a master-pilot in
the Spanish navy, who had sailed with Piedra in
1778; and had since been the chief practical officer
engaged in the survey originally undertaken by that
commander. In the four years which had elapsed
since the commencement of that service, he had himself
examined and laid down the Bays of Anegada
and of Todos Santos, the bar of the River Negro,
and the ports of San Antonio, of San Joseph, and
that to the south called Porto Nuevo. He had also
surveyed the River Colorado for about seven leagues
from its mouth. No man, then, in those parts could
be better qualified for the task, and no expense or
supply was spared, that he might be furnished with
everything likely to ensure his success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Four large launches (chalupas) were fitted out,
to which masters, carpenters, caulkers, and ample
crews were appointed, besides a number of peons
with horses, who were to attend them along the
banks of the river to assist in reconnoitring the
country, and in towing the boats against the stream,
when contrary winds might prevent their sailing.</p>

<p>On the 28th September, 1782, they started from
the settlement of Carmen, and were absent till the
25th of May following; and, although on some points
they did not perhaps realize all the expectations of
those who sent them, yet they certainly obtained much
new and valuable information, and for the first time
determined correctly the course of the great river
they ascended, and proved the possibility of navigating
it to the very foot of the Andes.</p>

<p>The heavy Spanish launches unfortunately proved
ill-calculated for the service, and could make but
little way with the fairest wind against the force of
the stream. They were obliged in consequence continually
to have recourse to the towing-rope, a tedious
and laborious operation, which occupied them a
whole month before they reached the great island of
Choleechel, about seventy leagues, according to their
daily reckoning, from Carmen.</p>

<p>This island<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> (the eastern extremity of which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
found to be in latitude 39&deg;) is not only one of the
most remarkable features in the map of the River
Negro, but is a point of great importance connected
with the inroads of the Aucazes Indians into the
Province of Buenos Ayres. It is here that, in their
journeys from the Cordillera, they leave the course of
the Negro and strike across to the River Colorado,
whence their beaten track runs straight to the mountain
ranges of the Ventana and Vulcan, where they
pitch their tents, recruit their horses, and watch for
a favourable opportunity to scour the Pampas, and
carry off the cattle from the defenceless estancias on
the frontiers of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>Being at all times greatly encumbered with their
women, children, and cattle, and having no notion of
anything like a raft or canoe to facilitate the passage
of the rivers they have to cross, they are obliged to
resort to those points where they are fordable, and
afterwards to follow such routes as will lead them by
places affording sufficient pasture for the daily maintenance
of their horses and cattle. Now, in their
descent from the Cordillera, their only pass across
the great River Neuquen is just above its junction
with the Negro, the course of which they are forced
afterwards to follow as far as the Choleechel, from
the impracticability of the country to the north of it,
and the scarcity of fresh water for their animals.</p>

<p>The great importance, therefore, of any military
post at this point, will be at once evident, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Villari&ntilde;o
did not hesitate to give his strong opinion to his
superiors, that a fort built here, with a small Spanish
garrison, would be one of the most effectual checks
upon these savages, and the best defence for the
cattle owners of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>After fifty years of further experience, this suggestion
(in 1833) has been acted upon by General
Rosas, the present Governor, and the Choleechel,
now called Isla de Rosas, has been occupied as a
military station.</p>

<p>After reaching their tracks, it was not long before
the Spaniards fell in with a party of the Indians
themselves, travelling by the river's side towards the
Cordillera. Villari&ntilde;o, anxious to conciliate them in
order to obtain their aid as he proceeded, was at first
lavish in his presents to them, particularly of spirits
and tobacco, which appeared to be the objects most
in request among them. The more, however, they
got, the more they wanted; and upon the first hesitation
to comply with their unreasonable demands, they
became as insolent as they were importunate. They
conceived suspicions, too, of the real designs of the
Spaniards in exploring those parts, and shrewdly
enough guessed that some more permanent occupation
of their country was projected&mdash;an idea in which
they were confirmed by the lies of a vagabond who
deserted to them from the boats, and whose first
object, of course, was to sow the seeds of dissension
between them and his countrymen, in order to facilitate
his own escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Although they dared not openly attack the Spaniards,
they soon gave manifest proof of their determination
to thwart the progress of the expedition by
every means in their power. Riding on in advance
of the boats they destroyed the pasturage along shore,
and, hovering just out of the reach of danger to
themselves, annoyed the party by all kinds of petty
hostilities, and kept Villari&ntilde;o in continual alarm for
the safety of his peons and cattle.</p>

<p>This conduct on the part of the natives, added to
the certainty now acquired, that the service would
be one of much longer duration than had been contemplated,
made Villari&ntilde;o pause before he proceeded
farther, and finally, determined him to halt where
he was till he could communicate with Carmen,
and receive from thence such further supplies as
would render him independent for the rest of the
voyage.</p>

<p>In passing the Choleechel, he had been much
struck with a little peninsula, covered with rich
pasturage, and easily made defensible against the
Indians; and thither he now returned to await
the further assistance he had applied for to his superior.</p>

<p>By running a sort of palisade across the narrow
isthmus which separated their position from the
main, and landing their swivels from the boats, the
Spaniards soon formed a little fortification<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
secure from any sudden attack on the part of the
Indians, but of them they saw nothing more so long
as they remained there.</p>

<p>Six weeks elapsed before Villari&ntilde;o received answers
to his letters, conveying to him the orders of
Don Francisco Viedma, to proceed with the expedition;
but in the interval the river fell so considerably
that Villari&ntilde;o became alarmed (and not, as it
appeared, without good cause,) lest he should be
driven into the season when the waters were at their
lowest, which would greatly add to his difficulties as
he advanced:&mdash;nor was this the worst:&mdash;though Don
Francisco had sent him an ample supply of provisions
and other necessaries for the prosecution of the
enterprise, he had at the same time peremptorily
ordered him to send back all the peons with their
horses, under the idea that this would be the surest
means of obviating any future disputes or collision
with the Indians. Villari&ntilde;o, without time to remonstrate,
had no option but to obey this order, though
he saw at once that it deprived him of his main-stay,
and would necessarily very much retard his future
progress.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, on the 20th of December,
the boats once more got under sail to proceed up
the river. Its winding course rendered the sails of
little use, and it was hard work without the horses to
make way against the force of the stream, the rapidity
of which, as well as the difficulty of getting
along, was much increased by innumerable small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
islands, which stud the river above Choleechel; indeed
the men were nearly worn out, as might have
been expected, with the toil of working at the towing-rope
almost continually.</p>

<p>In ten days they only advanced twenty-four
leagues; they were not then sorry to fall in again
with some of their fellow-creatures, albeit they were
Indians, from whom they procured some horses,
which relieved them from this part of their labour at
least. They too were journeying westward, and
much information was obtained from them respecting
the upper parts of the river which greatly encouraged
them to proceed, for there seemed little doubt from
their accounts, that it was navigable to the foot of
the Cordillera, from whence they might easily communicate
with Valdivia.</p>

<p>These Indians were returning to their ordinary
haunts on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera, over
against that city, and they readily offered their assistance
to the Spaniards to show them the way over,
when they arrived at their lands, which they described
as being near the Huechum-lavquen, or lake of the
boundary spoken of by Falkner. They said it was
not more than three days' journey from thence to
Valdivia, with the people of which it appeared they
were in the habits of intercourse, and among whom
they found ready purchasers for all the cattle they
could carry off from the Pampas. Thus it appeared
that the people of Buenos Ayres might thank their
countrymen on the shores of the Pacific for a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
part of the depredations they were continually complaining
of from the hostile incursions of these savages.</p>

<p>This party was a fair sample of the evil consequences
of such a system. It consisted altogether of
about 300 people under their caciques, who had left
their country more than a year before for the sole
purpose of collecting cattle for the Valdivians; and
they were now on their way home with about 800
head, every animal of which bore a Buenos Ayrean
mark, and had been stolen from some estancia in
that province. They were less shy than the Indians
whom the Spaniards had before fallen in with, and
so long as they got plenty to eat and drink they
journeyed on by the side of the boats in apparent good
humour, giving such assistance as was in their power,
and such information as they could with respect to
the country they passed through. But this did not
last long; and when after about a fortnight they
found that Villari&ntilde;o could not afford to make the caciques
and their wives drunk every day they changed
their tone, and even went so far as to lay a plot for
getting the boat's crew on shore on pretence of a
feast, in order to rob and murder them. Frustrated
in this by a timely discovery of their treachery, they
suddenly galloped off, carrying with them, however,
two of the men, whom it was supposed, by means of
their women, they had contrived to inveigle from the
boats.</p>

<p>Cunning and treachery, Villari&ntilde;o observes, seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the special characteristics of these people; thieves by
habit, plunder is the object of their lives, and to obtain
it fair means or foul are alike justifiable in their
eyes. Kindness is thrown away upon them, and
fear alone seems to have any influence over them
which can be calculated upon.</p>

<p>In thirty days from their leaving Fort Villari&ntilde;o,
the boats arrived at the confluence of the River
Neuquen, or Sanquel-leub&uacute; as it is sometimes called
by the Indians, from the huge canes or reeds which
overgrow its banks. This river was erroneously
supposed by Villari&ntilde;o to be the Diamante, and he
did not hesitate to lay it down as that river, and to
express his belief that had he gone up it in twenty-five
days he should have found himself in the province
of Mendoza. Subsequent information has corrected
this error, and shown it to be the river <i>Neuquen</i>,
which here joins the Negro, and which, rising
a little above Antuco, is increased by many other
streams from the Cordillera, which subsequently fall
into it.</p>

<p>Villari&ntilde;o was blamed for not exploring this river,
certainly by far the most considerable affluent of
the Negro. He seems to have satisfied himself
with merely ascending it in a little boat for about a
couple of leagues, which brought him to the place
where the Indians are in the habit of crossing it, and
where he doubted whether there was sufficient water
at the time to allow the launches to go up, though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
from the vestiges of the floods along shore, it was
evidently navigable at times for much larger craft.
His best excuse for not doing more was his anxiety
to reach the Cordillera before the state of the snow
should prevent his communicating with Valdivia.
To make the best of his way onward in that direction
was now his main object; but the difficulties
he had as yet experienced were nothing to those
which awaited him in his further progress. The
horses obtained from the Indians were completely
worn out, and after passing the Neuquen, the whole
labour of towing the boats along again devolved
upon the men.</p>

<p>About a league above the junction of the
two rivers, the latitude was found to be 38&deg; 44&acute;.
The course of the Negro shortly afterwards was
found to incline very much more to the south, apparently
turned off by the prolongation of a chain of
hills from the north, which equally determines the
course of the Neuquen higher up, and as far as the
eye can reach from the point of its junction with the
Negro.</p>

<p>Through these hills the Negro has either found,
or forced a passage, which on either side is bounded
by steep, rocky escarpments, rising 500 or 600 feet
above it; and here the stream ran with such violence,
that it was with the greatest difficulty the launches
were dragged on, one by one; a difficulty further
increased by the shallowness of the water, which
made it necessary in many places to deepen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
channel with spades and pick-axes, and to unload
the boats and carry their cargoes considerable distances,
before they could proceed<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>All this caused incredible fatigue to the men,
unaccustomed to such service, and supported only
on the dry and salt provisions they had with them.
Their legs became swelled with working for days
together in the water, and they were covered with
sores from the bites of the flies and mosquitos which
hovered in clouds above its surface. The scurvy
broke out, and some of them became seriously ill:
fortunately they fell in with some apple-trees, the
fruit of which was a great comfort to the sick; but
the snow-capped peak of the Cerro Imperial, as
well as the whole range of the Cordillera, was now
in full view before them; and the hope of being
soon in communication with Valdivia gave them
fresh courage, and redoubled their exertions to reach
their journey's end.</p>

<p>Two whole months were spent in making a distance
of forty-one leagues from the Neuquen. This
brought them, on the 25th of March, to the foot of
the great range of the Cordillera, and to an island
about a mile and a half long, where the main stream
was found to be formed by two distinct rivers, there
uniting from opposite directions; the one coming
from the south, the other from the north.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p>As they knew by their latitude, which a little before
reaching this point they had found to be 40&deg; 2&acute; S.,
that they were already to the south of Valdivia, Villari&ntilde;o
had no hesitation as to which of these rivers
he should attempt to ascend. Before going on,
however, he determined on giving the men a day or
two's rest, of which he availed himself to make a
short excursion in his little boat up the southern
fork, which turned out to be a river of some magnitude.</p>

<p>At its mouth, he says, even at that time, when
the waters were at their lowest, it was about 200
yards across, and about five feet in depth; its course
from the S.S.W., running with much velocity through
a deeply-cut channel over a bed of large rounded
stones: the country, as far as could be seen, was a
desolate mass of gravel. Some little way up, they
found the burial-place of an Indian cacique, over
which two stuffed horses were stuck upon stakes,
according to their custom; further on, the shore was
strewed with trunks of many large trees brought
down by the floods; they were of various sorts, but
principally pine and cedar, probably the same as
is shipped in large quantities from the opposite
side of the Cordillera, and from Chiloe, for other
parts of Chile and Peru. From the Indians they
subsequently learned that dense forests of these
trees were to be met with higher up the river.
How valuable they would be to the settlers on the
Rio Negro, and how easily they might be floated
down to them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Villari&ntilde;o named this river the Rio de la Encarnacion.
By the Indians, it is called Lim&eacute;-leub&uacute;, or
the river of leeches: indeed they call the main stream
so, during its whole course to the junction of the
Neuquen; after which, they give it the appellation
of Curi-leub&uacute;, the River Negro. They described
it as proceeding from the great lake of Nahuel-huapi,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
where, in the year 1704, the Jesuits established a
mission, which was afterwards destroyed by some
hostile savages, and the Fathers murdered. The
vestiges of their habitations and chapel still remain,
and that part of the country is called by the Indians
Tuca-malal, probably from some allusion to the
ruins; the inhabitants call themselves Huilliches, or
the southern people. Through them, to Villari&ntilde;o's
surprise, the Pehuenches Indians, whom he shortly
afterwards fell in with, had already received accounts
of the establishment of the Spaniards at San Julians;
the news had doubtless been carried to them
by the friendly Indians, with whom Viedma had
been in communication at that place, and whom
he speaks of in his diary as having gone northward
on an expedition which lasted four months, to buy
horses from the Indians in that direction.</p>

<p>But if the Spaniards were surprised to hear these
people speak of their countrymen at San Julians, 600
miles off, they were much more so, to be asked by
them if the war between Spain and England was over.
In this, however, it turned out that they had a more
direct interest than might have been expected; certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
articles of European manufacture which they
had been in the habit of purchasing from the Valdivians
having become scarce and dear, from the
interruption of the trade of that place with Spain in
consequence of the war. Who would have supposed
that the Indians of Araucania could have known or
cared whether England and Spain were at war or not?</p>

<p>Having taken this cursory view of the Encarnacion,
Villari&ntilde;o returned to continue his voyage up the
northern branch of the Negro, which is called the
Catapulich&eacute; by the Indians. It would perhaps be
more correct to consider, as they do, the Encarnacion
as the upper part of the Negro, and the Catapulich&eacute;
as an affluent joining it from the opposite direction.
Its shallowness prevented their making much way
up it; after much labour and difficulty, in twenty
days they had only advanced ten leagues, and then
all hope of getting further was at an end. This was
on the 17th of April, when they were in latitude 39&deg;
40&acute;, over against Valdivia.</p>

<p>The Catapulich&eacute; runs along the base of the Cordillera,
distant five or six miles; it is joined by
several streams from the mountains, which irrigate
the intervening slopes and plains, and form good
pasture-grounds for the Indians; and here they
found their old acquaintances, who had run away
from them lower down the river; and who, nothing
abashed by what had passed, came at once to the
boats to beg for spirits and tobacco.</p>

<p>Villari&ntilde;o, restraining his indignation at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
effrontery, renewed his intercourse with them in the
hope of obtaining their assistance in reaching Valdivia;
which, by their accounts, was not more than
two or three days' journey distant across the mountains.
Deputations arrived also from the Pehuenches,
and Aucazes, Araucanian tribes in the
neighbourhood, who showed a great readiness to be
of any use;&mdash;they brought the Spaniards fruit and
other necessaries, and everything promised a speedy
realization of their wishes to be placed in communication
in a few days with their countrymen on the
shores of the Pacific. At the moment, however,
when they were looking forward to the speedy accomplishment
of this object, their hopes were blasted
by an unlucky quarrel amongst the Indians themselves,
in which one of their principal caciques,
Guchumpilqui, was killed. His followers rose to
avenge his death, and Chulilaquini, the chief who
killed him, fled with his tribe to the Spaniards, earnestly
soliciting their protection; to obtain which the
more readily, he told a plausible story of a general
league being formed amongst the Indians to attack
them on the first favourable opportunity, and that it
was in consequence of his refusal to join in this coalition,
that the dispute had arisen which cost Guchumpilqui,
the principal in the plot, his life. As this
Guchumpilqui was the leader of the tribe they had
met with on the Rio Negro, whose man&#339;uvres had
already impressed Villari&ntilde;o with the belief that he
meditated some such treachery, he was quite pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>pared
to credit Chulilaquini's tale; and thinking it at
any rate advisable to secure the aid of some of the
savages, he too readily promised him the protection
he asked for. This brought the expedition to an end.</p>

<p>As soon as it was known that the Spaniards were
disposed to take the part of Chulilaquini, they were
regarded as declared enemies, and preparations were
made to attack them. The Indians were bent on
avenging the death of their chief, and it was soon
evident that, as to communicating with the Valdivians
under the circumstances, it was out of the
question. After some fruitless efforts, at any rate, to
get a letter conveyed across the mountains, Villari&ntilde;o
was reluctantly obliged to make up his mind to return.
Since entering the Catapulich&eacute;, much snow
and rain had fallen, which had increased its depth as
much as three or four feet: it had become in fact a
navigable river, instead of a shallow stream. Their
Indian allies helped them to lay in a stock of apples,
of which there are great quantities in all those parts,
and of pi&ntilde;ones, the fruit of the pine-tree, which,
taken out of the husk, is not unlike a Barbary date
in taste as well as appearance; and with these supplies
they once more got under weigh, the swollen
stream carrying them down rapidly and safely over
all the shoals and dangers which had cost them so
much toil and difficulty to surmount as they went up;
the land too, had put on a new appearance after the
rain, and many places which appeared arid and steril
wastes before, were now covered with green herbage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
With little more than an occasional oar to keep them
in the mid-stream, they went the whole way down
to Carmen without the smallest obstruction, and
arrived there in just three weeks from the time of
leaving the Catapulich&eacute;, after an absence altogether
of eight months. Thus it was proved to be perfectly
practicable to pass by this river from the shores of
the Atlantic to within fifty or sixty miles of Valdivia
on the Pacific, the mountain-range alone intervening.</p>

<p>To what beneficial account this discovery of an
inland water communication across the continent
might in the last fifty years have been turned by an
enterprising people, it is difficult to calculate. The
Spaniards seemed rather desirous to conceal than to
publish the fact of its existence. Till the expedition
of General Rosas in 1833, against the Indians,
no boat ever again went up the Negro higher than
Choleechel; and but that I obtained possession of
Villari&ntilde;o's Diary during my residence at Buenos
Ayres, and published the substance of it in the
"Journal of the Geographical Society," his Enterprise
would probably have been consigned to perpetual
oblivion.</p>

<p>Chulilaquini followed the boats, and settled his
people within reach of his Spanish friends, in the
neighbourhood of Carmen; but the Indians, in general,
looked upon the new settlement with the greatest
jealousy, and became extremely troublesome.</p>

<p>In this state of things, Don Juan de la Piedra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
who it has already been stated was originally sent
from Spain to take command of the establishments
in Patagonia, and who had never ceased to remonstrate
against the act of the Viceroy, which deprived
him of that command, was reinstated by orders from
the government at home; and proceeded in consequence
to the Rio Negro, to resume his functions
as principal Superintendent (1785); over-anxious,
perhaps, after what had passed, to distinguish himself,
instead of making any attempt to conciliate the
Indians, he boastingly took the field, and advanced
into their lands to attack them, with a force totally
inadequate to the purpose: the consequence was,
that he was surrounded and totally defeated. He
himself perished miserably, and several officers fell
into the hands of the savages: happily for them,
some relations of the victors were at the same time in
the power of the Viceroy, and the hope of recovering
them by exchange, induced the savages for once to
save the lives of their prisoners.</p>

<p>Amongst them was Don Leon Ortiz de Rosas,
father of the present Governor of Buenos Ayres, then
a Captain in the King's service, who turned his captivity
to such good account, that he not only succeeded
in an extraordinary degree in conciliating the respect
and good will of the principal Caciques, but finally
brought about a peace between them and the Viceroy,
which lasted many years, and deservedly established
the celebrity of the name of Rosas throughout
the pampas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spanish government for a short time took some
interest in the establishment on the Negro:&mdash;upwards
of 700 settlers were sent there from Gallicia,
and large sums were spent upon it; but the expectations
formed of its importance were not realized.
The colonists remained satisfied to carry on a petty
traffic with the Indians for skins, instead of launching
out upon the more adventurous speculation of the
fisheries upon the coast, and the authorities at Buenos
Ayres, finding them more expensive than useful, became
indifferent about them, and allowed them to
sink into the insignificance of a remote and unprofitable
colony.</p>

<p>Thus, in 1825, when the war between Buenos
Ayres and Brazil broke out, there were hardly 800
inhabitants. The blockade of the river Plate made
it then a resort for the privateers of the Republic, and
once more brought it into notice. A small coasting
trade is now carried on with it, and many seal-skins
are collected there to be sent to Buenos Ayres, as
well as those of the guanaco, hare, skunk, and other
animals, brought in by the Indians from the deserts
further south: it has of late years also furnished occasional
supplies of salt for the Saladeros of Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p>Had the government of Buenos Ayres been able to
exercise any efficient superintendence over the adjoining
coast, the fishery of seals, and seal elephants,
might have become of importance; but in the absence
of all control, the unrestrained and indiscrimi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>nate
slaughter of the young as well as of the old
animals has driven them from their former haunts
further south, where they are still found by the English
and North American fishermen, who know their
<i>rookeries</i>, as they are called; and in the proper season,
take them in great numbers.</p>

<p>The Governor of Carmen is an officer appointed
from Buenos Ayres, to the Junta of which province
the inhabitants name a representative.</p>

<p>Piedra's orders confined him to the east coast of
Patagonia, as has been shown in the preceding
chapter; but in 1789 Spain sent forth an expedition
of much more importance, especially in a scientific
point of view.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The ships employed were the <i>Atrevida</i> and <i>Descubierta</i>,
under the command of the well-known
Malaspina, who not only revised Piedra's and Viedma's
surveys of Patagonia, but, rounding Cape
Horn, explored the greater part of the coast of
the Pacific, from its southern extreme to the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
settlements in the north-west. Malaspina, upon his
return, was thrown into a dungeon and deprived of
his papers,&mdash;why, has never transpired; nor was it
till several years afterwards that those admirable
charts, the results of his labours, were published by
order of Langara, the Spanish Minister of Marine,
which have since been so useful to modern navigators
in the South American Seas, and will long
be an honour to the Spanish navy. Malaspina's
name, however, was not permitted to be affixed to
them, neither has the journal of his voyage ever
been published.</p>

<p>It is only very recently that the details have been
discovered at Buenos Ayres of the first portion of
his work, viz., the survey, in 1789, of the whole of
the northern and southern shores of the Plate, as
high up as the Paran&atilde;, in which nearly 150 points
were fixed by him. In the Appendix all those of
any importance will be found, in a tabular form,
together with other positions, determined on good
authority.</p>

<p>It was this survey, with the soundings afterwards
taken by Oyarvide (who lost his life in completing
them), that furnished the materials for the chart of
the river Plate, officially published at Madrid in
1810: nor was this all that Buenos Ayres owed to
Malaspina: upon his return to Valparaiso from the
north-west coast, he detached two of his most intelligent
officers, Don Jos&eacute; Espinosa, and Don Felipe
Bauza, well known in this country, to map the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
across the pampas; and by them the true positions
of Santiago in Chile, of Mendoza, San Luis, the post
of Gutierres on the river Tercero, and other points
along the line, were, for the first time, determined.
Their map, so far as it extends, is the best, and
the only one of that line of country, I believe, ever
drawn by any one capable of taking an observation.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Whilst they were thus engaged in fixing one part
of the geography of the interior, the Viceroy turned
to account the temporary sojourn at Buenos Ayres
of some of the officers attached to the commission
for laying down the boundaries under the treaty of
1777 with Portugal, and employed them in mapping
other portions of the territory under his immediate
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In 1794 M. Sourreyere de Souillac, the astronomer
of the third division of that commission,
laid down the line of road from Buenos Ayres to
Cordova, and fixed the latitude of that city in
31&deg; 26&acute; 14".</p>

<p>In 1796 Azara, with Cervi&ntilde;o and other officers
employed on the same service, made a detailed survey
of the frontiers of the province of Buenos Ayres,
in the course of which they fixed the positions of
all the towns and forts of any importance between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>Melinqu&eacute;, its north-western extremity, and the most
southern bend of the river Salado, beyond Chascomus.
That river they found to have its origin in
a lake in latitude 34&deg; 4&acute; 45", longitude from Buenos
Ayres 3&deg; 36&acute; 32"; it is an insignificant stream, of
trivial importance till joined by the Flores.</p>

<p>Thus materials were collected for laying down a
considerable portion of country upon the very best
authorities; but, like the surveys of the coast, many
years were suffered to elapse ere they were made
available to the public. Bauza's map was not published
till 1810, and it was only in 1822 that the
positions fixed by Azara in 1796 appeared for the
first time as his in the "Statistical Register," published
that year at Buenos Ayres. De Souillac's
might have remained unknown for ever, had not
Se&ntilde;or de Angelis lately brought them to light; as
well as Malaspina's "Fixed Points on the Shores of
the River Plate."</p>

<p>But, after all, however valuable were these data
in perfecting a knowledge of the country already
occupied, they led to no new discoveries, and by far
the greater part of the interior of the continent, to
the south of the Plate, remained unexplored, till
Spain becoming involved in the general war carried
on between the great powers in Europe, her colonial
subjects on the shores of the Pacific began to experience
more or less inconvenience from the stoppage
of their ordinary trade. They found that the
ships which used to visit them direct from Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
for the most part ran into the river Plate, rather
than encounter the increased risk of capture in the
longer voyage round Cape Horn; and it became
therefore to them an object of considerable importance
to shorten, if possible, the over-land journey
from thence to the opposite side of the continent,
and particularly to the southern parts of Chile.</p>

<p>This led to explorations being set on foot by the
public authorities, in the years 1803, 1804, and 1805,
the result of which was, the discovery of several
new passes over the Cordillera, south of Mendoza,
one of which, the pass de las Damas, was examined
by the same M. de Souillac, already spoken of, who
reported that at a very small expense it might be
made practicable for the passage of wheel-carriages.
It only remained to be shown whether or not it was
possible to travel in a direct line across the pampas
from any of those passes to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>In this state of things, Don Luis de la Cruz, an
enterprising officer who had seen much of the Indians,
offered to start from Antuco, in the province
of Conception, the most southern of the passes yet
known, to endeavour to reach Buenos Ayres by a
straight course across the pampas. This proposal
was accepted by the Governor of Chile, and in order
to secure as far as possible the co-operation of the
native tribes, which indeed was absolutely necessary
to the success of the undertaking, the Caciques of
the Pehuenches, who inhabited the country on the
eastern slopes of the Cordillera, were summoned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
hold a grand parlamento, or parley, to consider it.
There had been long a friendly intercourse between
them and the Spaniards, who, moreover, had at times
afforded them protection from the attacks of their
enemies; they therefore did not hesitate on this
occasion to intimate to them that they expected in
return all the good offices and aid which they could
give to Cruz and his party.</p>

<p>They attended at the time appointed, and after a
grave discussion after their fashion, which lasted
several days, they agreed to take the expedition
under their particular protection, and see it safe to
Buenos Ayres; Cruz, on his part, engaging that
the Indians who accompanied him should be presented
to the Viceroy, rewarded with suitable presents,
and sent back in safety to their friends at the
conclusion of the service. This pact was ratified
with much formality; the hand of Cruz being solemnly
placed in that of the most ancient of the
Caciques, to signify that thenceforward he was
under his special care.</p>

<p>Whist the expedition was preparing, Cruz spent
a couple of days in an unsuccessful attempt to get to
the summit of the volcano in the vicinity of Antuco,
which he describes as being then in continual action,
and at times burning so strongly as to be visible
from a very considerable distance: but he was
stopped, and obliged to turn back, by a heavy fall
of rain and snow, considered by the Indians as an
interposition of the Deity to prevent the examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of a region which they held it to be forbidden to
mortals to approach.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April (1806), all being ready, the
party left the fort of Ballenar, near Antuco, to commence
their journey. It consisted of twenty persons,
viz., Cruz and four officers, a surveyor to
measure the daily distances, and fifteen attendants,
besides their Indian escort; having with them carts
and horses and all things they might want on the
way. Striking across the pampas in as direct a
course for Buenos Ayres as the nature of the country
would permit, in forty-seven days they arrived at
Melinqu&eacute;,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the north-western frontier fort of that
province, having travelled, according to their measured
daily journeys, rather more than 166 leagues;&mdash;adding
68 more for the distance between Melinqu&eacute;
and Buenos Ayres, made the total distance from
Antuco to that city, by this route, 234 leagues;&mdash;being
75 less than the ordinary post-road from
Buenos Ayres to Mendoza.</p>

<p>The narrative which Cruz subsequently drew up
of this expedition is extremely diffuse, and would be
tiresome to most readers from the extreme minuteness
with which he has thought it necessary to detail the
daily discussions and parleys which, upon every
trivial occurrence, took place with the Indians.</p>

<p>In a geographical point of view, the most interesting
part of it is that in which he describes the rivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
which he crossed after descending the Cordillera;
from which I have attempted in the map to give an
idea of them, differing, as will be seen, from that
hitherto adopted. In this I have been also much
guided by the observations, in my possession, of
the late Dr. Gillies, my correspondent for many
years at Mendoza, who had himself been as far
south as the river Diamante, and had taken great
pains to collect information respecting the geography
of that part of the country.</p>

<p>The old notion was, that nearly all the rivers
south of Mendoza uniting in one wide stream, to
which the Diamante, as one of the principal affluents,
gave its name, ran direct south into the Rio
Negro; and this, as I have mentioned in the preceding
chapter, was Villari&ntilde;o's idea, and led him,
without hesitation, to believe that the great river,
whose mouth he explored, and which, he says, he
does not doubt would have led him to Mendoza, was
the Diamante.</p>

<p>From a careful examination of Cruz's journal, and
other data in my possession, I am satisfied this will
be found to be an error, and that the great river
which flows into the Negro is the Neuquen, which
Cruz crossed on the sixth day after he left Antuco,
at the place called Butacura, and about eighteen
leagues on his journey. The Neuquen<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> is formed
by many streams from that part of the Cordillera,
all which Cruz names, and the principal of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
appear to be the Rinqui-leub&uacute;, which descends from
the mountain of Pichachen, and further north the
Cudi-leub&uacute;, the drain of many small rivers. No
one, he says, doubts that the Neuquen, from the
junction of the Cudi-leub&uacute;, is navigable as far as
the Rio Negro, and thence to the ocean.</p>

<p>Proceeding in a north-easterly direction, Cruz fell
in with another, considerable river, as large, he says,
as the Neuquen, called by the Indians the Cobu-leub&uacute;,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
whose sources they reported to be in the
Cordillera of Curriliquin, over-against the province
of Maule, in Chile; and they spoke of seven rivers
which fell into it in its course from the north to the
place where the expedition crossed it. Cruz says
distinctly <i>it does not fall into the Neuquen</i>, but,
changing its southerly course about where they
passed it, it ran eastward, in which direction the
travellers kept it in view, at times coasting it, for
several days, till at a place called Puelec it again
turned towards the south, taking thence, as the Indians
affirmed, its course to the sea. This river,
there can be no doubt whatever, is the Colorado,
which falls into the sea a little to the north of the
Rio Negro.</p>

<p>The hilly ranges of the Cordillera were found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
extend about ten leagues beyond the pass of the
Cobu-leub&uacute;, above spoken of, after which the pampas
commence, which continue unbroken to Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p>Two days after passing Puelec, whence the river
Cobu-leub&uacute; takes a southerly course, and having gone
about seventy-four leagues by their daily computation
from Antuco, the travellers reached the river called
by the Indians <i>Chadi</i>-leub&uacute;, or the <i>Salt</i> River (probably
a continuation of the Atuel), which, uniting
with the Desaguadero, or Drain of the Diamante,
about five leagues below where they crossed it, discharges
itself into a vast lake about ten leagues
further south, called by the Indians the Urr&eacute;-lauquen,
or the bitter lake.</p>

<p>In old times, according to Dr. Gillies, the Diamante,
which he says rises from the eastern base of
Cauquenes Peak in the Cordillera, fell into the
Atuel a little below Fort San Rafael, where it will
be seen on reference to the map that the two rivers
very nearly approximate; but about twenty-five
years ago it took another course, forming for itself
a separate channel, by which it discharges itself into
the Desaguadero, which carries to the south the
waters of the rivers Tunuyan and Mendoza, and is
finally lost with the Chadi-leub&uacute; in the great salt
lake above mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>The Chadi-leub&uacute;, according to Cruz, was one of
the most considerable of the rivers he had yet passed.
The people and houses crossed it swimming, and the
baggage was carried over in a balsa, a sort of hide-raft.
It formed the boundary of the lands of the
Pehuenches, and many were the debates which ensued
amongst Cruz's Indian companions as to the
probable view which the tribes in the pampas beyond
would take of the expedition.</p>

<p>One day it was the dream of some old woman,
another, the augury of a soothsayer, that excited
their doubts and alarms, and made them hesitate
as to the propriety or not of going on with the
Spaniards. In their embarrassment, however, they
made a notable discovery, which was no other than
that Cruz held constant communication with a spirit
which directed him in all his proceedings:&mdash;he
was observed continually to refer to it, and the
spirit, which was his watch, was heard to give
out certain mysterious sounds whenever consulted.
Cruz had no desire to deceive them, but the impression
was not to be got rid of, and it was so far
of use that it inspired them with fresh courage to
go on.</p>

<p>It was determined, after much consultation, to
send forward an embassy to the Caciques of the
Ranqueles tribes, who lived in the pampas beyond,
and especially to Carripilum, the most influential
amongst them, to announce the approach of the
expedition, and its peaceable objects, and to endeavour
to propitiate them beforehand in its favour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Fortunately, Carripilum was in good humour, and,
in the belief that he should get presents in proportion
to the importance of the expedition, not
only received them with honour, but resolved to
accompany them himself to Buenos Ayres, where
Cruz assured him the Viceroy would welcome his
arrival, and be glad to enter into treaties with him
for opening a new road through his territories for
the Spaniards trading between Buenos Ayres and
Chile.</p>

<p>In twenty-nine days after passing the Chadi-leub&uacute;,
and in forty-seven after their departure from
Antuco, the travellers arrived at the fort of Melinqu&eacute;,
on the north-west frontier of the province of Buenos
Ayres; where, whilst halting to refresh themselves,
and to allow the Indians to celebrate their safe, arrival,
according to their custom, in beastly drunkenness,
some straggling soldiers, flying from the rout,
brought in the disastrous intelligence of the landing
of the British troops under General Beresford, and
the fall of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The dismay of poor Cruz at this unexpected intelligence
may be easily imagined. Encumbered with
a numerous party of Indians who had accompanied
him across the continent, far from their homes, in
the expectation of the rich presents they were to have
upon their arrival at Buenos Ayres, and relying
upon promises which it was now totally out of his
power to fulfil, he was in the greatest embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>To proceed was out of the question; and as to
going to Cordova, whither it was reported the Viceroy
had fled, it was evident that at such a time
matters of much more pressing importance would
prevent his attending to the objects of the expedition.
His resources too were utterly exhausted.
The Indians, however, who soon heard reports
of what had happened, evinced a degree of good
feeling which could hardly have been expected
from them under the sore disappointment of their
own expectations. Having heard from Cruz a confirmation
of the bad news, they at once expressed
themselves satisfied that it was impossible for him to
fulfil his engagements towards them, and announced
their resolution to relieve him from any difficulty on
their account by returning whence they came. All
they desired was, that he would duly report to the
Viceroy that they had faithfully, and as far as they
could, fulfilled their engagements, so that they might
claim their due reward in better times. The Pehuenches
did not part without much lamentation
from their Christian friends, and they repeated
again and again their readiness to obey any orders
the Viceroy might be pleased to send them. Carripilum
made the same protestations, and left one of
his relations to proceed with Cruz in search of the
Viceroy, expressly to make an offer of any aid
which the Spaniards might desire from the Indians
against the common enemy.</p>

<p>Cruz found the Viceroy at Cordova, who received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
him with kindness, and paid every attention to the
Cacique who accompanied him. He was equipped
in a new suit of Spanish clothes, and after a time
dismissed with presents and every demonstration of
the high estimation in which the Viceroy held the
services of Carripilum and his companions.</p>

<p>Don Luis himself, upon the recovery of Buenos
Ayres, repaired thither, and drew up the diary of his
interesting journey, which, like those of Villari&ntilde;o and
Viedma, and many other interesting papers of the
same sort, was thenceforward consigned to oblivion
in the secret archivo.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The various important political
events which shortly afterwards began and
rapidly succeeded each other were, however, perhaps
some excuse for its remaining unnoticed.</p>

<p>In describing the eastern parts of the Cordillera,
Cruz says that, at the time he was there, only the
volcanoes of Antuco and Villarica were in activity,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
though the traces of others extinct might be seen in
every direction:&mdash;the evidences of their ancient
eruptions, he says, might be followed for thirty
leagues continuously:&mdash;he speaks, amongst other
volcanic appearances, of hot springs resorted to
by the Indians for their medicinal qualities, and
says so abundant is the sulphur in all those parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>that several rivers are strongly impregnated with
it; vast quantities also of bituminous substances are
everywhere to be seen, and beyond the Neuquen,
he says, there is an abundance of coal.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Nor is
there good ground for doubting his assertion, since
on the opposite side of the Cordillera, in about the
same latitude, coal has long been known to exist,
and has been occasionally used by the foreign vessels
trading with that part of Chile. Near the sources
of the Neuquen are mines of rock-salt: in the level
lands, also, between that river and the Chadi-leub&uacute;,
salt may at all times be collected from the surface
of the ground, and the intermediate streams are all
more or less brackish from its influence.</p>

<p>Fossil marine remains appear to abound amongst
the lower ranges of the Cordillera which Cruz passed,
not only strewed over the surface at considerable
elevations, but deeply imbedded in the soil, as might
be seen wherever sections were formed by the courses
of the mountain-torrents.</p>

<p>In addition to his description of their country,
Cruz has added to his journal some account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
manners and customs of the Pehuenches;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> those Indians
who take their name from the abundance of
pine-trees in the lands they occupy, derive their
origin from the Araucanian race inhabiting the
southern parts of Chile; as indeed do all the wandering
tribes found in the pampas from the frontiers
of Mendoza and Cordova to the Rio Negro in
the south:&mdash;they all speak a common language, and,
if their customs in any degree vary, it will only be
found to arise from the greater or less distance they
are removed from their original stock, or as they are
brought into occasional contact with their Christian
neighbours. Divided and subdivided into innumerable
petty tribes, or rather family groups, they wander
from place to place in quest of pasturage for the
sheep and cattle which constitute their sole possessions;
continually quarrelling and fighting with each
other, and rarely united by any common object save
to make some occasional plundering expedition against
the defenceless properties of the Spaniards on the
frontiers. Such at least are the habits of those
generally known as the Pampas, and Ranqueles,
tribes; but of them I shall speak more particularly
in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The Pehuenches, whose customs Cruz describes,
appear to be a somewhat better race. They are
not so far removed from their original stock in
Araucania; and their vicinity to the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of Chile, and friendly intercourse with them, has
had a manifest influence in modifying their original
habits.</p>

<p>In person they are described as fine men, stouter
and taller than the inhabitants of the plains, but,
like all the Indians of the same stock, in the habit
of disgustingly bedaubing and disfiguring their faces
with paint. They wear a sort of cloak over the neck
and shoulders, with another square cloth fastened
round the loins, and those who can get them, little
conical hats bought from the Spaniards, and the same
sort of boots as are made by the gauchos of Buenos
Ayres from the dried skin of a horse's leg fitted to
the foot. The bridles of their horses are beautifully
plaited, and often ornamented with silver: spurs of
the same material are in great request amongst them,
and are eagerly purchased of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The women as well as the men paint themselves:
<i>their</i> chief ornaments consist of as many gold or
silver rings as they can collect upon the fingers, and
large ear-rings, resembling both in size and shape a
common English brass padlock.</p>

<p>Their habitations consist of tents made of hides
sewn together, which are easily set up and moved
from place to place. Their principal food is the
flesh of mares and colts, which they prefer to any
other; if they add anything in the shape of cakes or
bread, it is made from maize and corn obtained from
the Spaniards in exchange for salt and cattle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
blankets, of the manufacture of their women, for it
is rarely they remain long enough in the same place
to sow and reap themselves.</p>

<p>Their Caciques or Ulmenes, as they call them, are
generally chosen either for their superior valour or
wisdom in speech&mdash;occasionally, but not always, the
honour descends from father to son: they have but
little authority in the tribe, except in time of war,
when all submit implicitly to their direction.</p>

<p>They are not, however, entirely without laws and
punishments for certain crimes, such as murder,
adultery, theft, and witchcraft. Thus he who
kills another is condemned to be put to death
by the relations of the deceased, or to pay them
a suitable compensation. The woman taken in
adultery is also punishable with death by her husband,
unless her relations can otherwise satisfy him.
The thief is obliged to pay for what he is convicted of
stealing; and, if he has not the means, his relations
must pay for him. As to those accused of witchcraft,
they are burnt alive with very little ceremony;
and such executions are of frequent occurrence, inasmuch
as a man rarely dies a natural death but it is
ascribed to the machinations of some one in communication
with the evil spirit. The relatives of the
deceased, in their lamentations, generally denounce
some personal enemy as having brought about his
end, and little more is necessary to ensure his condemnation
by the whole tribe: sometimes in his
agony the unhappy victim names others as his accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>plices,
and, if the dead man be of any importance
amongst them, they too are often sacrificed to his
manes in the same barbarous manner.</p>

<p>As to their religion, they believe in a God, the
creator and ruler of all things, though they have no
form of worship: they also believe in the influence of
an evil spirit, to whom they attribute any ill that
befalls them. They consider that God has sent them
into the world to do right or wrong as they please;
that, when the body perishes, the soul becomes
immortal, and flies to a place beyond the seas, where
there is an abundance of all things, and where
husbands and wives meet, and live happily together
again.</p>

<p>On the occasion of their funerals, that they may
want for nothing in the other world to which they
have been used in this, their clothing and accoutrements,
and arms, are buried with them; sometimes
a stock of provisions is added; and when a Cacique
is buried his horses are also slain and stuffed with
straw, and set upright over his grave. The internment
is conducted with more or less ceremony,
according to the rank of the deceased:&mdash;if he be a
man of weight amongst them, not only his relations,
but all the principal persons of the tribe, assemble
and hold a great drinking-bout over his grave, at
which the more drink, the more honour.</p>

<p>They have great faith in dreams, especially in those
of their ancients and Caciques, to whom they believe
they are sent as revelations for the guidance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
tribe on important occasions; and they seldom
undertake any affair, either of personal or general
importance, without much consultation with their
diviners and old women as to the omens which may
have been observed.</p>

<p>Marriage is an expensive ceremony to the bridegroom,
who if obliged to make rich presents, sometimes
all he is worth, to the parents of his love, before
he obtains their consent. Thus daughters are
a source of sure wealth to their parents, whilst those
who have only sons are often ruined by the assistance
which is required from them on these occasions.
Such as can afford it take more wives than
one, but the first has always precedence in the
household arrangements, and so on in succession.</p>

<p>When a child is born it is taken with the mother
immediately to the nearest stream, in which after
both are bathed, the mother returns to her household
duties, and takes part in preparing for the
feast that follows.</p>

<p>In almost all these habits, the Pehuenches appear
to fellow the Araucanians, of whose manners and
customs Molina has given a full account in his
History of Chile.</p>

<p>The mother of one of my servants lived seven
years amongst these savages, and confirmed Cruz's
account on all the points I have here stated. In
general, she said, she was as kindly treated by them
as was possible under the circumstances:&mdash;she had
been taken by the Pampas Indians, and by them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
sold to the Pehuenches, that she might have less
chance of escaping and ever reaching her own home
again. Men, women, and children, she said, lived
much more on horseback than on foot.</p>

<p>A knowledge of their language might assist
much to make us better acquainted with their
country, for their nomenclature of places, as well
as of persons, is rarely insignificant. I have already
stated that the Pehuenches derive their name
from pehuen, the pine-tree, which abounds on the
slopes of the Cordillera where they dwell. The
Ranqueles are so called from ranquel, the thistle,
which covers the plains which they inhabit. The
Picunches take their name from picun, the <i>north</i>.
The Puelches signify the people to the east, and the
Huilliches those to the south: <i>che</i> means people.</p>

<p>The following will serve as examples of some of
the appellations of their Caciques:&mdash;Culucalquin,
the Eagle; Maripil, the Viper; Ancapichui, the
Partridge; Quilquil, the Little Bird; Guayquiante,
the Sun; Cari-mangue, the Condor; Antu-mangue,
the Ostrich; Pichi-mangue, the Vulture; Paine-mangue,
the Old Condor.</p>

<p>Ignorance of the Buenos Ayreans respecting the lands south of the
Salado previously in their Independence. Colonel Garcia's expedition
to the Salt Lakes in 1810. The Government of Buenos
Ayres endeavours to bring about an arrangement with the
Indians for a new boundary. Their warlike demonstrations
render futile this attempt. March of an army to the Tandil,
and erection of a Fort there. Some account of that part of the
country. The coast as far as Bahia Blanca examined, and extension
of the frontier-line as far as that point. The hostility of
the Indians makes it necessary to carry the war into the heart
of their Territories. General Rosas rescues from them 1500
Christian captives. Detachments of his army occupy the Choleechel,
and follow the courses of the River Negro and of the
Colorado till in sight of the Cordillera.</p></div>


<p>Having given some account of the explorations of
the Old Spaniards beyond Buenos Ayres, I shall
now proceed to state what has been done by their
successors since their independence. It is inconceivable
the ignorance which, up to a very recent
period, existed amongst even the higher classes of
the people of Buenos Ayres respecting the Indian
territories which immediately bounded their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
lands to the southward. It is indeed only by a
laborious investigation of the history of their frontiers,
and of the steps taken from time to time to
advance them, that we can even now obtain any
tolerable notion of the physical features of that part
of the continent. This, however, is worth the
trouble, as it will furnish materials for laying down
a considerable portion of country hitherto most imperfectly
and erroneously described in all existing
maps.</p>

<p>One of the first attempts made by the Independents
to acquire accurate data respecting the country
to the south of the Salado appears to have been in
1810, on the occasion of one of the periodical expeditions
to the great salt lakes in the south. Those
expeditions formed a singular exception to the ordinary
supineness and indisposition of the Spaniards
to cross their own frontiers. They consisted of
large convoys of waggons dispatched under direction
of the municipal authorities to collect salt for
the yearly supply of the city, escorted by a military
force to protect them from the Indians. Of their
apparent importance some idea may be formed
from one, of which an account has been preserved,
and which took place during the time of the Viceroy
Vertiz, in 1778, composed of 600 waggons,
with 12,000 bullocks, and 2600 horses, and nearly
1000 men to load them, besides an escort of 400
soldiers. The Indians, on these occasions, were pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>pitiated
by suitable presents, and, as the caravans
never deviated from their object, they became habituated
to them, and, instead of regarding them
with jealousy, in general rather looked forward with
eagerness for the annual tribute in the shape of
presents which the Spaniards were ready to pay
them for an unmolested passage across their territories.
They even lent the people their assistance
at the salt-lakes to load their waggons in exchange
for beads and baubles from Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The Viceroy occasionally attached some pieces of
artillery to the troops, and generally availed himself
of the opportunity to make a salutary display amongst
the savages of the military discipline and power of
the Spanish soldiers, which no doubt had its due
effect; but no one thought of turning these expeditions
to any further account:&mdash;they never departed
from the same direct and beaten track across the
pampas, and not the slightest pains were taken to
collect any further information respecting the country
beyond, at least in the time of the Old Spanish
rule.</p>

<p>The members of the National Government, set
up in 1810, were animated by a different spirit:
they foresaw with the dawn of their new destinies
the prospect of their becoming a commercial people,
and the consequent necessity of giving such encouragement
to the extension of their pastoral establishments
as would tend to the multiplication of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
staple commodities of the country. The extension
of their frontiers, and their due protection by military
posts were consequently among the first objects
of their attention; and when the annual expedition
to the Salinas was about to set out, they took
care to select an officer for the command of it
qualified to reconnoitre the country and to collect
such information as might assist them in determining
upon their future plans for an extension of their
territorial jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Colonel Garcia, the officer in question, had previously
seen much of the Indians on the coast of
Patagonia. He was of a conciliatory disposition,
and was on many other accounts eminently qualified
for the task committed to him. From the
diary of his expedition, which is in my possession,
it appears that the caravan or convoy placed under
his charge, on this occasion, consisted of 234 waggons,
with 2927 bullocks, and 520 horses attached
to them. His attendants, including soldiers, were
407: they had also two field-pieces with them.
Nor was this considered a large party, compared
with former expeditions with the same object; indeed
Garcia soon found to his cost that his force
was hardly sufficient to secure him common respect
from some of the many Indian Caciques, who, from
the time of his leaving the frontier fort of Cruz de
Guerra to his arrival at the Salinas, successively
besieged him with their importunities for presents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
especially of tobacco and spirits, and kept him in
continual alarm lest they should attempt to carry
off by force what they could not obtain by
other means. Each who presented himself called
himself master of the lands they were passing
through, and expected corresponding presents to
purchase his permission to pass forward. Nor was
this the worst: it appeared that something had
given rise amongst the Indians to a suspicion of
the ulterior objects of the Buenos Ayreans; and,
under an impression that they projected a forcible
settlement in their lands, the Ranqueles tribes
from the plains south of San Luis and Mendoza,
under their principal Cacique Carripilum (the same
spoken of in the foregoing chapter), had collected
their forces with the secret determination to endeavour
to cut off the whole party. Fortunately the
fidelity of some of the Puelches, or Eastern tribes,
who hate and are continually at variance with the
Ranqueles, enabled Garcia to discover and disconcert
their hostile plans, and finally, though with considerable
difficulty and danger, to accomplish his
object, and return with his convoy of salt-carts in
safety to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>Amongst the results of this expedition was the
determination by observation of seventeen points
along the line of road from the Guardia de Luxan,
in lat. 34&deg; 39&acute;, long. west of Buenos Ayres 1&deg; 2&acute;, to
the Great Salt Lake in lat. 37&deg; 13&acute;, long. west of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Buenos Ayres 4&deg; 51&acute;;<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> the whole distance travelled
being 97 leagues, or, adding 24 for that from Luxan
to the capital, 121 from Buenos Ayres. The journey
out occupied 23 days, and the return 25; altogether
the party was absent just two months, viz., from
the 21st of October to the 21st of December.</p>

<p>The only features which seem worthy of remark
along the road are the numerous lakes, which
appear to be the collections of the streams from
the western ramifications of the Sierra Ventana;
the most considerable of which is the Laguna del
Monte, in lat. 36&deg; 53&acute;, long. from Buenos Ayres
3&deg; 57&acute;; its name, the Lake of the Wood, is taken
from a large island upon it covered with fine timber;
it is formed by the river Guamini, and other streams
from the mountain group so called; its width was
estimated to be three or four leagues, and in the rainy
season it forms one with the lakes of Paraguayos,
extending more than seven leagues to the south-west.</p>

<p>Although, the Laguna del Monte was salt, it was
observed that the waters of some of the smaller
lakes in its immediate vicinity were perfectly sweet.
The same observation was made at the Salinas; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
sweetest water was abundant in the immediate
vicinity of the Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p>Shortly before reaching the lake of Paraguayos,
the Sierra de la Ventana and its ramification, the
Guamini, were seen and particularly observed:
the Sierra Guamini bore south 15&deg; east, and
the Ventana south-east a quarter east. There they
were met by several of the best-disposed of the
Caciques and their followers, who supplied them
with cattle in exchange for the articles they had
with them. They accompanied them to the Salinas,
which they reached two days afterwards; and to
them they owed their protection from the hostile
Renqueles and Carripilum, whose treachery they
discovered and exposed.</p>

<p>Speaking of the character of these Indians,
Garcia says they are remarkable alike for their
cowardice as for their ferocity: their warfare is a
system of continual deceit and treachery, and their
stolen victories are always signalized by savage
cruelties. Nothing could exceed their submissive
obsequiousness to the Spaniards from the moment
they knew they had an intimation of their
hostile intentions, and were upon their guard
against them. The prevailing vice amongst them
all, even the best of them, is drunkenness,&mdash;the
Caciques set the example upon every occasion; and
it is seldom that their orgies end without the loss
of lives, for in their cups they are always quarrelsome:&mdash;then
the slightest offence is remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and they draw their knives, wounding and killing
one another, and falling upon all, even their nearest
relations, who would attempt to restrain them. Of
all the Indians the Ranqueles are the worst:&mdash;they
may be called the bush-rangers of the pampas:&mdash;if
they cannot rob the Spaniards they will make war
upon the other tribes, to carry off their horses and
cattle. The Puelches, on the contrary, or eastern
people, at that time settled about the Salinas and
the mountains towards the coast, were found to be
more peaceably disposed: they were the possessors
of large herds and flocks of their own, and the
manufacturers of many articles in demand amongst
the Spaniards, such as ponchos, skin-cloaks, bridles,
and feather-brooms, which they used to sell to them
at Buenos Ayres and on the frontiers.</p>

<p>The extent of the Great Salt Lake is not given, and
Garcia says it was impossible to ride round it from
the thick woods which lined its banks; but, from an
eminence a little to the south, he got a general view
of it, as well as of the country for a considerable
distance. Looking towards the south, as far as he
could see, was one immense level plain, covered with
pasturage: to the eastward, in the distance, some
woods were visible, which, he was told, extended
to the hilly ranges of Guamini and La Ventana.
On the opposite side, to the westward of the lake,
was a vast forest of cha&ntilde;ar, algaroba, and an infinite
variety of other trees, which the Indians told him
extended with little interruption for three days'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
journey in that direction; and they added the
singular circumstance that, about a day and a half
off in the midst of it, upon a hilly range of some
extent, were to be seen the ruins of the brick buildings
of some former inhabitants (antigua poblacion),
though, as to who they might have been, or when
they ceased to exist, they had not the smallest notion,
neither had they any tradition which could
throw light upon it. The fruit-trees, they said,
which, had been planted there, had multiplied exceedingly,
so that it was a great resort of the Indians
in their journeys across the pampas, to gather
figs, peaches, walnuts, and apples, and other fruits,
of which there was an abundance for all that
went there. Wild cattle also, they said, were in the
surrounding forest, but they were not so accessible,
and were difficult to follow up through the woods.
Colonel Garcia hazards no conjecture as to who
could have been the settlers in this secluded and
remote spot, nor has any one else obtained since any
further account of them. The age of the trees
might perhaps throw some light upon the date of
the buildings, and I imagine that the names alone
of those I have mentioned are sufficient to indicate
that they must have been of European introduction,
and consequently that those who planted them must
have done so subsequently to the discovery of that
part of the world by the Spaniards. Nothing,
I was told, existed at Buenos Ayres which could
throw any light whatever upon the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the practice continued of carrying on these
expeditions, it is probable that the Buenos Ayreans
would have become better acquainted with the
southern part of the pampas; but, upon the opening
of an unrestricted trade, the importation of salt from
the Cape de Verd Islands and other countries rendered
it unnecessary for the government to put itself
to any expense about them; and, as individuals without
the protection of the troops would not run the
risk of encountering the Indians, the Salinas ceased
to be resorted to, and the people of Buenos Ayres
became reconciled to purchasing of foreigners an
article of which they have an inexhaustible supply
within their own territory.</p>

<p>Garcia proposed to the government to form a
military settlement at the Salinas, to be the central
point of a line of frontier to be drawn from the
river Colorado across the pampas to Fort San-Rafael
on the river Diamante, south of Mendoza. This he
conceived would effectually check the depredations
of the Ranqueles and their thievish associates, whilst
the friendly and well-disposed Puelches Indians to the
south, he was tolerably assured, would at that period
have been glad to have been brought under the immediate
protection of the government of Buenos
Ayres. The principal Caciques of the latter were
three brothers, from the vicinity of Valdivia, where
in their early life they had learned to respect the
Spaniards, and to appreciate the benefits of keeping
up a friendly and well-regulated intercourse with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
them. Nowhere had the king's officers taken such
pains to conciliate the native tribes as in Chile, and
so well had that system of treating them answered,
that, in the present case, these brothers declared
there was nothing they desired more than the permanent
establishment of a more intimate connexion
between them and the people of Buenos Ayres, and
that they would gladly place themselves and their
followers under the immediate protection of the government.</p>

<p>But Garcia's plan embraced more than could be
done at once by the rulers of Buenos Ayres; and
partly, perhaps, on that account, and partly because
all their disposable forces and means were shortly
afterwards required to carry on the struggle for
their independence, it was, with many other projects
laid aside, and many years elapsed ere any
further step was taken.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the results of their new political
condition developed themselves, as was anticipated,
and the increase of their trade led to the extension
of their pastoral establishments. Although the government
took no measures for their protection, the
people of the country began to occupy the lands to
the south of the Salado, which soon brought them
into contact and collision with the Indians, who, on
their part, looked with a very natural jealousy upon
settlements planted without their concurrence on
lands which from time immemorial they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
accustomed to consider as exclusively their own.
The more peaceable tribes retired to the fastnesses
in the mountains to the south, but the Ranqueles
and other migratory hordes retaliated by carrying off
the cattle and plundering those who had thus intruded
themselves within their territories. In these
marauding expeditions they were often joined by
some of the vagabond gauchos, deserters from the
army, and such wretches flying from the pursuit of
justice as, in times of civil commotion especially, are
to be found in all countries. By those unprincipled
associates they were soon taught to look with less
dread upon the fire-arms of the Buenos Ayrean
militia, and even to use them, whenever, either by
the murder or robbery of some defenceless estanciero,
they fell into their hands. Nor was this the worst.
During the unhappy civil dissensions which broke
out between Buenos Ayres and the provinces, some
of the unprincipled leaders of the reckless factions
which divided the Republic sought alliances with
the Indians,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the fatal consequences of which they
only too late discovered. Like bloodhounds it was
impossible to restrain them. When once the
weakest points were shown them, they burst in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
upon the frontier villages, murdering in cold blood
the defenceless and unprepared inhabitants, and
carrying off the women and children into a slavery
of the most horrible description.</p>

<p>It was manifest that the impunity with which
these outrages were committed arose mainly from
the total absence of any protection on the part of
the government for those settlers who had advanced
their estancias beyond the old forts within the line
of the Salado, and the public voice called loudly
for some prompt remedies for the evil, the most
efficacious of which appeared to be the adoption of
some one of the many plans from time to time proposed
for a new line of military posts to cover the
rural population south of that river; the hilly
ranges of the Vuulcan, especially, seemed to present
a natural frontier which it appeared only necessary
to occupy to secure the object; but the information
respecting all that part of the country was
still exceedingly imperfect; and it was determined,
therefore, in the first instance, to send out an exploratory
expedition to examine them. This led to
Colonel Garcia being again called upon to proceed
to the south, with the double object of endeavouring
to induce the Indians to enter into an arrangement
with the government of Buenos Ayres for a
new boundary as the basis of a general pacification,
and of acquiring precise information as to the most
eligible positions for the establishment of military
posts in the hilly ranges in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The communications he had had twelve years before
with the leading Caciques of the tribes inhabiting
the country eastward of the Salinas led him
vainly to hope that those tribes at least might be
brought to acquiesce peaceably in the views of the
government, and, provided they were left in possession
of the lands they occupied in the vicinity of the
Sierra Ventana, that they would not oppose the
occupation by the Buenos Ayreans of the more
northern line of the Vuulcan and Taudil; but Garcia
was not aware of the great change which had
taken place in the feelings and policy of the Indians,
from a variety of circumstances, since his journey to
the Salinas in 1810.</p>

<p>The messengers, however, sent forward to announce
his mission were well received, and a respectable
deputation, headed by Antiguan, one of
their principal chiefs, was sent forward to meet and
to conduct the ambassador and his suite to their
toldos at the foot of the Sierra Ventana, where the
Caciques of the Puelches proposed the negociations
should be opened, promising to invite thither at the
same time representatives from all the tribes of the
Pampas, not excepting the Ranqueles, and the
Huilliches or People of the South, inhabiting the
lands as far as the rivers Colorado and Negro.</p>

<p>Under this escort, and accompanied by Colonel
Reyes, an engineer officer, and about thirty persons,
soldiers and peons, Colonel Garcia set out from
Lobos for the Indian territory on the 10th of April,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
1822. On the 12th they crossed the Salado at a
place where its depth allowed of the safe passage
of carts, and where its width was not above thirty
or forty feet; this was some way above the junction
of the Flores, after which it becomes a river of more
consequence, its breadth extending to 300 yards in
the winter season, when it is impassable except in
canoes. The next day they crossed the Saladillo at
the pass of Las Toscas; this stream falls into the
Salado a little above the river Flores, towards
which they proceeded through a country much intersected
by swamps, which obliged them to deviate
continually from their direct course. When near
the Lake de las Polvaderas, Colonel Reyes, being
desirous to take an observation, produced his
sextant, which led to an unexpected but serious
manifestation of alarm and suspicion on the part of
the Indians. Some foolish person, it appeared,
when they were setting out had told them that the
commissioners had with them instruments through
which they could see all the world at once, and
nothing would satisfy them, when they saw them
brought out, that the Spaniards were not in direct
consultation with the gualich&ugrave;, or devil himself. It
was impossible to do away with this notion of theirs,
which led to the inconvenience of obliging the officers
afterwards to take their observations by the stars at
night instead of by the sun in the day-time.</p>

<p>About two leagues beyond where they crossed
the Flores they verified its junction with the Ta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>palquen
in a vast marsh. The Flores is in fact
but the drain of the waters of that river; it was
found to be more brackish than even the Salado.
In the thick jungles along its banks many tigers
were seen, which, however, excited little apprehension
compared with the horseflies and mosquitos,
from whose venomous attacks there was no escape.
They followed the Tapalquen till they came in sight
of the Sierra, distant ten or twelve leagues, the
Amarilla Hills bearing south-south-east, and those
of Curaco south-south-west; between these two
groups runs one of the passes frequented by the
Indians in their journeys to the Ventana, where
the travellers halted, and in the night, whist their
Indian guides were asleep, by an observation of
Mars, determined the latitude to be 36&deg; 45&acute; 10";
the longitude they fixed at 54&deg; 13&acute; from Cadiz;
variation 17&deg; 10&acute;.</p>

<p>The following morning, making a pretext for
lagging behind out of sight of their Indian
friends, they reconnoitred the pass, and determined
with a theodolite the height of some of the
hills in its immediate vicinity; the highest point
of the Amarilla, or Tinta group, called Lima-huida,
south-east of the pass, was 200 feet, and the
two peaks of Curaco, which they had seen at a
distance the day before, measured, the one 270,
and the other about 200 feet. A small guard-house
or fort would effectually close this pass against the
Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>To the south of this part of the chain, the
country is a succession of hills and dales, watered
by many streams from the Sierra, and apparently
well adapted for an agricultural settlement. Taking
a course about south-south-west, on the third day
after leaving the pass of Curaco they came in
sight of the second range of mountains, called the
Sierra de la Ventana, and arrived at the toldos of
Antiguan their conductor, whose people, apprized
of their approach, came out in great numbers, men,
women, and children, to receive them. Antiguan
lost no time in despatching messengers in every
direction to summon the general meeting of the
Caciques, whilst Colonel Garcia encamped with his
little party on the borders of a lake, where it was
determined that the grand parlamento, or parley,
was to be held. Thither they were attended by a
friendly old cacique, Lincon, whom Garcia had
known and made a friend of on his former expedition,
and to whose advice and assistance they were
in the sequel very essentially indebted. From him
they learnt that the chiefs of the Ranqueles were
far from peaceably disposed, or inclined to take
part in any treaties with the government of Buenos
Ayres for their lands; and that there existed generally
amongst the Indians much jealousy and distrust
of the Spaniards, in consequence of the measures
they had of late been taking with respect to
them. He warned them, also, not to be surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
at any warlike display which might be made at the
approaching meeting, as it was probable that the
Caciques would avail themselves of the opportunity
to show the number of fighting men they could
command.</p>

<p>It was fortunate they had some such notice of
what they were to expect; for when, in two or three
days afterwards, the Indians assembled, they certainly
made an appearance much more like a general
gathering of armed forces for war than of negociators
for peace.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for the general conference,
a body of about 200 men made their appearance
at an early hoar, formed in battle array, and slowly
advancing towards the commissioners' tents to the
sound of horns (cornetas). On arriving within a
short distance, they broke into small parties, uttering
loud shouts, and charging over the plain, making
cuts and thrusts in the air right and left with their
swords and lances, and then wheeling about and
riding round and round their leader, who apparently
directed these man&#339;uvrings. The principal object
of all this, the commissioners were told, was to drive
away the gualich&ugrave;, or evil spirit, whose secret pretence
they apprehended might otherwise maliciously
influence the approaching negociations.</p>

<p>The trappings of some of the horses of these
warriors were curiously ornamented with beads, and
hung, about with little bells. Several of them wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
sort of helmet, and a buff coating of hide, so well
prepared as to be perfectly soft and flexible, though
several times double; the helmets made of it are so
tough as to resist the cut of a sword, and sometimes
are bullet-proof.</p>

<p>This was but the advanced-guard of a numerous
host which afterwards came in view, covering the
horizon, and making really a very imposing appearance.
Altogether there might be something
more than 3000 fighting men regularly marshalled
under their respective Caciques in nine divisions.
Though these Indians belonged to the <i>soi-disant</i>
friendly tribes, the commissioners could not fail to
be struck at once with the quantity of arms and
accoutrements amongst them, which were manifestly
the spoils of war and of their own countrymen
murdered on the frontiers. Their whole demeanour,
too, was insolent and arrogant in the extreme, partaking
infinitely more of defiance than any real
desire for a permanent peace, which caused many
misgivings to Garcia and his officers as to the result
of their mission.</p>

<p>After a variety of martial man&#339;uvrings, on a
given signal a great circle was formed, in the midst
of which the Ulmenes or principal Caciques, taking
their places, commenced the parlamento by a preliminary
discussion amongst themselves as to
whether or not they should enter into any negociations
whatever with the government of Buenos
Ayres without the Ranqueles. On this point there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
were great differences of opinion, the most sagacious
of the speakers shrewdly prognosticating, that,
unless the peace was to be a general one, it was
useless to enter into it, inasmuch as, if hostilities
continued between the Spaniards and any of the
tribes, the rest could hardly fail, sooner or later, to
be involved in them. The majority, however, only
anxious to share at once the presents which they
understood the Spaniards to have brought with
them, and of which they probably feared that any
co-operation of the Ranqueles tribes would deprive
them of a portion, called aloud for an immediate
treaty, and the commissioners were conducted,
almost by force, to the place of deliberation, where
a scene of great confusion took place, every one
desirous to speak at once, and calling for the presents.
The circle was broken, and, the Indians
rushing in upon them, the officers with difficulty
extricated themselves from the press.</p>

<p>After a time the authority of the Caciques was
restored, and the conference resumed; the sole result
of which was, that the majority present insisted
upon treating at once with the Buenos Ayreans on
their own account, after which they said the commissioners
might proceed to negociate, as they
could, separately with the Huilliches, or southern
tribes, and with the Ranqueles. All this was rather
a dictation, on the part of the Indians, than any
mutual agreement; but it was evident there was to
be no alternative, and the commissioners, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the best face upon it, proceeded to distribute the
greater part of the presents they had brought for
the occasion,&mdash;the possession of which, it was perfectly
clear, was the main, if not the sole object of
the savages in entering at all into discussions with
them. These Indians all called themselves <i>Pampas</i>
and Aucases. The latter term, which signifies <i>warriors</i>,
seems to be assumed by many of the tribes of
Araucanian origin.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In the course of their parleys
with them, so far from finding them disposed, as
Garcia had flattered himself, to treat for a new and
more advanced boundary-line, they vehemently
complained of the encroachments already made by
the Buenos Ayreans, and insisted upon their withdrawing
the establishments already formed to the
south of the Salado. Garcia found it useless to
argue with them; and, as his personal safety would
probably have been endangered by a positive refusal,
he thought it better to temporize, and to promise to
lay their representations before the government of
Buenos Ayres on his return, contenting himself to
stipulate that there should be peace in the mean
time.</p>

<p>Having obtained all they could get, the Caciques
took their leave, leading off their followers to their
respective toldos. The next day they were succeeded
by another and distinct party of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Huilliches or southern people, who, though summoned
to the general conference, had not been able
to arrive in time to take part in it. This tribe presented
even a more martial appearance than the
others, and Colonel Garcia, describing them, says,
no regiment of cavalry could have made a more
regular or better figure than these strikingly fine
men. They were naked from the waist upwards,
and wore a sort of helmet surmounted by feathers (a
distinguishing feature in the dress of this tribe),
which added to their extraordinary stature. Their
Cacique Llampilco, or the <i>black</i>, was upwards of
seven feet high, and many others were equal to
him, and even taller. Most of them were armed
with very long lances, and, like the pampas tribes,
had their faces bedaubed with red and black paint;
but their language was different, and, Garcia says,
identical with that of the people from the southern
part of Patagonia, from whom he imagines them
to have sprung, and to the old accounts of whose
height he refers.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He speaks of them as a superior
and finer race of men in every respect than the
others; admirable horsemen, and brave in war,
without the cruelty of the pampas tribes, sparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
their prisoners, and treating strangers with kindness
and hospitality. They had come from the
lands south of the Ventana, about the rivers Colorado
and Negro, where they had located themselves,
according to their own account, to avoid collision
with the Spaniards, with whom they professed their
great desire to establish a solid peace. They spoke
with contempt and detestation of the marauding
habits of the pampas tribes and of the Ranqueles,
and offered at any time to assist in chastising them.
This party consisted of 420 fighting men. They
conducted themselves very differently from the
others, and with great propriety, receiving thankfully
what was given to them.</p>

<p>After their departure, the commissioners removed
to the lake where the Cacique Lincon's people were
located, and which bore his name. Its situation
was about five leagues from the mountain-range
beyond, something more than three to the west of
that on which the conferences had been held, and
about five and a half from one named after Pichiloncoy,
another friendly Cacique, of whom more
hereafter. From this place, looking to the north-west,
one boundless plain presented itself to the
eye. The Ventana mountain bore south-west, extending
its lesser ramifications to the west-south-west,
as far as the Curumual&agrave;, a small group of
hills which may be seen running west to the more
elevated range of Guamini; an extensive plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
running between them. The highest part of the
Guamini bore west 10&deg; north, and was lost in the
boundless pampas beyond.</p>

<p>A stay here for a few days gave them a tolerable
insight into the manners and customs of the natives.
Nothing could exceed the laziness and brutality, in
general, of the men, who, looking upon the women
as inferior beings, treated them as the most abject
slaves. Not only were they obliged to attend to all
the ordinary duties of the family, but upon them
also, devolved the care of their husbands' horses, and
even the tending of the sheep and cattle. Polygamy
was permitted, and, according to his means, it appeared
that a man kept more or less wives, which,
so far from causing jealousy, seemed generally a
source of satisfaction to the ladies themselves, inasmuch
as it led to the lightening by subdivision of
their domestic labours. Unless engaged in some
predatory excursion, or in hunting deer and guanacoes,
and other smaller animals, for their skins,
the men seemed to pass their whole time in sleeping,
drinking, and gambling, the habitual vices
of all the tribes:&mdash;they are passionately fond
of cards, which they obtain from the Spaniards,
and will play for ever at dice, which they make
themselves ingeniously enough, and, like gamesters
in other parts of the world, will stake their all upon
a throw, reckless of reducing their families to utter
destitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>In each toldo, or tent, which is made of hides
stretched upon canes, and easily removeable from one
place to another, five or six families, barely separated
from each other, perhaps twenty or thirty
persons in all, were closely huddled together in the
most horrible state of filth imaginable; indeed, in
many respects, they were but little removed in their
habits from the brute creation. If fuel was scarce,
as was often the case in the pampas, they cared not
to cook their meat, but ate it raw, and always
drank the warm blood of every animal they killed:&mdash;like
beasts of prey, there was no part, even to the
contents of the stomach and intestines, which they
would not greedily devour.</p>

<p>They were superstitious in the extreme, and the
credulous dupes and tools of a few artful men, who
are to be found in every tribe, and in reality
direct all its concerns by pretending to foretell the
future, and to divine the cause of every evil. They
are called <i>machis</i>, or wizards, and there is no
tribe without them, and which does not implicitly
submit to their decisions and advice. Their word
is law, and the Cacique even, equally with the
rest, submits to it. The commissioners themselves
were nearly made the victims of the malice of some
of these wretches, who probably anticipated a share
of the plunder, if they could have induced their
countrymen to destroy them. The old Cacique,
named Pichiloncoy, already mentioned as living
near the toldos of Lincon, and whose life was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
great consequence to his tribe, fell seriously ill, and,
according to custom, the machis were assembled to
pronounce on the nature of his complaint, and to
denounce those whose evil machinations or influence
could have reduced him to such a state, for in all
such cases some one must be responsible, and, once
denounced, his life is seldom spared if the patient dies.
In this case the machis unanimously ascribed the
old Cacique's illness to the presence of the Christians,
who, they declared, had brought the Gualich&ugrave;, or
evil spirit, with them, probably deriving the notion
from the report spread by their guides respecting
the supernatural powers of the instruments they
were known occasionally to consult. If the old
man had not fortunately recovered it might have
gone hard with them, for their lives would certainly
have been in great peril. As Garcia observes,
it would have been a pretty ending of their embassy
to have been sacrificed to the manes of old Pichiloncoy
by the mad machis.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the excessive nastiness and filth
of their general habits, the women seldom failed to
perform their daily ablutions, repairing the first thing
in the morning to the neighbouring lake to bathe
with their children, although the cold was so intense,
that the snow nightly beat through their tents
during the whole time the commissioners were
there. Amongst these females were some Christian
girls, captives, whose fair skin was but too
strong evidence of their origin, and who seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
from habit to suffer as little from the severity of
the cold as their dusky mistresses. Their unfortunate
lot excited the strongest feelings on the part
of the commissioners, whose interposition to obtain
their liberation they pleaded for, as well they might,
with tears and the most earnest entreaties. Nor
were the officers backward in urging upon the
Caciques every argument to induce them to give
them up; but it was amongst the greatest of their
disappointments to find all their efforts on this point
unavailing. The Caciques declared they had no
power in a case touching the spoils of war, which,
according to their laws, were the sole property of
the individual captors, to whom they referred them
to make the best bargain they could. These brutes,
on being applied to, demanded in general so extravagant
a ransom as to destroy at once every hope
on the part of the poor women themselves of its ever
being raised, their relatives in general being of the
labouring classes employed in the estancias on the
frontier; in many cases they too were no longer
in existence, having perished in the same inroads
of the savages which had deprived them of their
liberty.</p>

<p>In expectation that the treaties to be made with
the Indians would have led to the immediate liberation
of all prisoners, some poor people had obtained
leave to follow in the train of the commissioners, in
the hope of finding their wives and daughters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
carrying them back with them; and a most affecting
sight it was, as may well be imagined, to witness
their meeting again, and tender embraces after
so cruel a separation; but it was piteous indeed to
behold their subsequent despair on finding that the
interference of the commissioners was unavailing,
and that the purchase-money demanded for the prisoners
was totally beyond what they could ever hope
to raise. The parting again of these poor people
was perhaps one of the hardest trials to which
human nature could be subjected. Husbands and
fathers forced to leave their wives and daughters to
the defilement of brutal savages, with scarce a
hope of ever being able to obtain their release; it
need hardly be said that force was necessary to
separate them, and to restrain the men from acts of
violence which might have compromised the safety
of the whole party.</p>

<p>If slavery as carried on by Christian nations appears
so revolting to all our better feelings, and
excites our strongest sympathies on behalf of the
negro, whose condition, after all, is often perhaps
in reality ameliorated by being brought under
the protection of humane laws, and within the pale
of Christianity, what must it be when the case is
reversed, when the Christian woman, brought up in
at least the decent and domestic habits of civilised
society, falls into the power of a savage, whose
home is the desert, and who, though little removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
in his own habits from a beast of prey, looks down
upon the weaker sex as an inferior race, only made
to be subject to his brutal will and caprice?</p>

<p>Though the unhappy condition of these poor
women excited the sensibility of the commissioners
for an instant, it roused also their more manly feelings,
and satisfied them that the government of
Buenos Ayres owed it to its own honour, and to
humanity, to act with energy, and make some effort
of force to rescue these poor victims from the consequences
of their own supine and too lenient policy.
It was indeed evident that any attempt to secure a
permanent and satisfactory state of peace would be
futile without such a demonstration as would act
upon the fears of the Indians, and oblige them to
submit to such terms as the government might determine
to impose upon them.</p>

<p>Under this conviction the officers would have
returned at once to Buenos Ayres, had they not
been earnestly solicited by the inhabitants of some
other toldos about the Sierra Ventana to visit them
before their departure; a request they acceded to in
the hope of its enabling them to acquire some geographical
information with regard to that range.</p>

<p>On the 2nd they set out with old Lincon, who insisted
upon escorting them as far as the place of rendezvous.
Their course lay west-south-west, through
an undulating country, rich in pasturage, and studded
with small lakes, about which were generally found
small groups of Indians with their cattle. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
lakes in the summer season are for the most part
dry, and then the Indians remove within reach of the
mountain-streams. Towards evening they pitched
their tents on the banks of a stream called the
Quetro-eique, the Ventana about two and a half
leagues distant, where they found a large encampment
of Indians, who received them with rejoicings.
As far as the eye could reach the plains were
covered with their cattle and sheep.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting for the assembling of the Caciques,
the officers devoted two or three days to surveying:
following up the Quetro-eique about three and a half
leagues, they traced it to its sources on the side of the
Ventana. The height of the principal mountain, so
called, they determined by measurement to be 2500
feet above the level of the plain from which it
rises.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> To the north-west a chain of low hills
extends as far as a break by which they are
separated from the minor group called the Curumual&aacute;.
Through this break run two small streams,
the one called Ingles-malhuida, from the circumstance
of an Englishman having been put to death
by the Indians there, the other Malloleuf&uacute;, or the
White River; the course of both is from south-west
to north-east, running nearly parallel with the
Quetro-eique, and all, according to the Indian accounts,
losing themselves in extensive marshes beyond.
The rivers Sauce-grande and Sauce-chico,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
which fall into Bahia Blanca, rise from the southern
declivities of this range, according to the same authority.
Beyond the Curumual&aacute; is the group of the
Guamini, the most westerly part of this range. An
observation taken from their tents on the Quetro-eique
gave the latitude 37&deg; 50&acute;; longitude from
Cadiz 56&deg; 20&acute;; and thence a clear day gave them
a general view of the whole range. The Ventana
bore south 18&deg; west, prolonging its ramifications to
south 40&deg; west. The Curumual&aacute; south 60&deg; west,
extending to 80&deg;. The Guamini extended through
30&deg; as far as west 10&deg; north. The whole range
may be described as running from south-south-east
to north-north-west. The variation by repeated
calculations was 18&deg; 30&acute;, at the other range it had
been found as stated to be 17&deg; 10&acute;, and at the Lake
of Polvaderas 16&deg; 30&acute; east.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>When the Caciques and their followers were all
assembled there might be about 1500 men, who
were paraded by their chiefs much in the same
manner as before described. The same ceremonies
to drive away the gualich&uacute;, and the same preliminary
discussions amongst themselves, before they
commenced their parleys with the officers; and these
terminating precisely in the same unsatisfactory and
indefinite manner. The presents it was evident were
the only objects contemplated by the savages, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
when these were not produced quite so quickly as
they expected, an attempt was made to seize them
by force, and the officers themselves would have been
stripped, if not sacrificed, had not old Lincon bravely
protected them, and killed upon the spot with his
own hand two of the most forward of the assailants:
cowed by the old man's intrepidity, and the preparations
of their escort to defend themselves, the wretches
slunk away, and so ended in blood and confusion the
labours of the commissioners. To old Lincon they
owed their lives, and subsequent safety on their road
back to Buenos Ayres, whither they were glad to
return as fast as they could, under an escort furnished
by him and some of the more friendly tribes
of the Huilliches.</p>

<p>Their route homeward was by the Sierra Amarilla,
on the eastern slope of which rises the river Barancas,
which they followed some way: before it emerges
from the mountains it is joined by the Quetro-leuf&uacute;,
and both together form the Tapalquen. Beyond the
Sierra Amarilla was seen that group called by the
natives the Huellucalel, from which proceeds the
river Azul, the waters of which, running parallel
with those of the Torralnel&uacute; and Chapaleof&uacute;, are
lost in the marshes sixteen or twenty leagues distant
towards the Salado. Crossing the Tapalquen,
they once more found the beaten track to the Guardia
del Monte, which they reached in safety on the 28th
of May, after an absence of about six weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>In reporting the results of their mission they
recommended that the range of the Vuulcan should
be at once adopted as the boundary of the province
in that direction, and that a chain of military posts
should be established upon it, extending from the
sea-coast as far west as the Laguna Blanca, with a
sufficient force to overawe the savages and afford
efficient protection to such settlements as might be
made within that line.</p>

<p>The government, at last roused to the conviction
of the necessity of some vigorous demonstration
of physical force, in order to re-establish something
like that salutary fear of the superior military
power and discipline of the Christians, which, in old
times, had, to a certain degree, restrained and kept
the savages in order, adopted the suggestion, and
preparations on a considerable scale were made for
carrying it into effect. The construction of a fortification
on the Tandil was determined upon, and
the governor himself prepared to superintend the
work, and take the field against the savages with an
adequate force. The little army assembled for this
purpose was ready to march about the close of February,
1823. It consisted of 2500 men, seven pieces
of artillery, with a considerable accompaniment of
carts and waggons, and everything requisite for the
establishment of a permanent military settlement.</p>

<p>Instead of following the track of Garcia and his
companions, by the Tapalquen, after a consultation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
with some guides, who professed to be well acquainted
with the intervening country, General
Rodriguez determined upon marching direct across
it to the Tandil; an attempt, as it proved, more adventurous
than prudent. On the 10th of March the
troops left the Guardia del Monte, and had hardly
crossed the Salado when they found themselves in
the midst of apparently interminable swamps, thickly
set with canes and reeds higher than their horses'
heads. It was with great difficulty that the waggons
and artillery were dragged through; nevertheless
they foundered onwards as far as a lake, to
which, from the clearness of its waters, they gave
the name of Laguna Limpia; but there it became
absolutely necessary to halt in order to reconnoitre
the country before proceeding further. So far they
had been grossly misled by their guides, whose only
knowledge of the country it appeared had been acquired
in excursions in quest of nutrias, which
little animals are found in vast numbers in these
swamps; but nutria catching and the march of an
army accompanied by heavy waggons and artillery
are very different things, and the wonder is that all
the guns and baggage were not left behind in the
bogs. The marshes themselves are formed by the
streams which run into them from the hilly ranges
further south, and which seem not to have sufficient
power to force their way through the low lands
either to the Salado or to the sea-coast. Begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>ning
from the morass in which the Tapalquen joins
the Flores, they extend far eastward, and render
useless a considerable tract of country south of the
Salado.</p>

<p>The scouts returning brought accounts that they
had found the river Chapeleof&uacute;, the course of which
it was determined to follow to the Tandil, where
it was known to rise; but they had hardly left
the Laguna Limpia when they were beset by a
new danger, which, for a short time, threatened a
frightful termination to the expedition. A sweeping
wind blew towards them clouds of dense smoke,
followed by one vast lurid blaze, extending across
the horizon, and indicating but too clearly the approach
of one of those dreadful conflagrations, not
uncommon in the pampas after dry weather, when
the long dry grass, and canes and thistles, readily
igniting, cause the flames to extend rapidly over the
whole face of the country, involving all in one
common and horrible destruction. The gauchos,
on the first indication of danger, have sometimes
sufficient presence of mind to set fire immediately
to the grass to leeward, by which they clear a
space on which to take refuge before the general
conflagration reaches them; but there is not always
time to do this, much less to save the cattle and
sheep, great numbers of which perish in the devouring
element. Upon the present occasion the
guides seem to have lost their wits as well as their
way; and, but for the fortunate discovery of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
small lake near them, into which men and beasts
alike rushed, dragging the carts with them, the
whole army would have been involved in the same
tragical end. There, up to their necks in the
water, they remained for three hours, during which
the fire-storm raged frightfully round them, and
then, for want of further fuel, subsiding, left a desolated
waste as far as the eye could reach, covered
with a black stratum of cinders and ashes.</p>

<p>After these dangers the army continued its
march along the western bank of the Chapeleof&uacute;,
through a country which improved every step they
advanced towards the sierras beyond. Picturesque
and fertile, the lands seemed only to require to be
taken possession of to form a most valuable addition
to the territory of Buenos Ayres. The wandering
tribes of Indians usually dwelling there had, to all
appearance, abandoned them, and withdrawn further
south, no doubt in alarm at the preparations made
by the Spaniards to occupy them.</p>

<p>The wild guanacoes, and the deer, and the
ostriches ranged in thousands over the pastures of
their native regions, and, with hares, partridges, and
armadilloes, afforded abundant sport to those sent
out to shoot them. For some days the army
was almost entirely subsisted upon them. Vast
quantities of armadilloes, especially, were caught by
the soldiers. One memorable afternoon's chase is
recorded, in which upwards of 400 were taken;
and a more delicate dish than one of these little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
animals, roasted, in his own shell, I will venture,
from my own experience, to say, is not to be had
in any part of the world. The rivers and lakes
swarmed with wild and water-fowl of every sort,
named and nameless, from the snipe to the beautiful
black-necked swan peculiar to that part of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>An observation was taken on the Chapeleof&uacute;
in latitude 37&deg; 17&acute; 34"; shortly after which the
army left its course, and marched eastward to the
Tandil, where they encamped, and whence the surveying
officers reconnoitred the surrounding country,
and determined upon the site for the new fortification.</p>

<p>The position of the fort constructed there has
been fixed by repeated observations in latitude
37&deg; 21&acute; 43"; longitude, west of Buenos Ayres,
39&acute; 4"; variation 15&deg; east. It stands upon a small
eminence, one of a lower group of hills which
skirts the more elevated range beyond, and from
which it is divided by the bed of a streamlet,
which, after passing the works, about a quarter
of a league to the eastward, and being joined
by another from the westward, forms the river
Tandil, which runs north till lost in the marshes
in that direction already spoken of. It is screened
to the west and north-west by a range of hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
rising 300 or 400 feet above it, the summits of
which are strewed with large masses of quartzose
rock, having a very remarkable appearance when
seen from a distance. The highest part of the
range of the Tandil, about two leagues to the
south-east of the fort, was ascertained to be about
1000 feet above the level of a small stream which
runs along its base. It is visible from a distance of
forty miles. The height of this part of the range
gradually falls off till lost in a wide plain or vale,
about twelve miles eastward of the fortification.</p>

<p>The climate in winter was found to be very cold;
the prevailing winds from the south and south-west.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
In the month of April the thermometer was twice
1&frac12;&deg; below freezing-point; but variations of 20&deg; and
even 30&deg; in the course of the day were of common
occurrence. In that month (April) the highest of
the thermometer was 68&deg;, the lowest 28&frac12;&deg;; in May
the highest was 61&deg;, the lowest 31&deg;; in June the
highest was 72&deg;, the lowest 39&deg;; in July the highest
was 79&deg;, the lowest 41&deg;. In the summer the heat
was almost insufferable, particularly in the low
lands; but in the spring and autumn, which are
the best seasons, the weather was found temperate
and very agreeable.</p>

<p>Whilst the fort was building on the Tandil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
communications were opened with the Indians residing
near the Ventana, proposing to them to
join in active operations against the Ranqueles
tribes&mdash;the Spaniards thinking, as on other occasions,
to invoke the tribes in war with each other,
and to profit by the weakening of both parties; but
the Indians were this time upon their guard. They
saw clearly enough that the march of such an army
into their territory could have only one object,&mdash;the
forcible occupation of their lands,&mdash;and they took
their measures accordingly with their usual astuteness
and cunning. Assenting, apparently, to the
general propositions made to them, they invited the
Buenos Ayrean general to repair with his principal
officers to the neighbourhood of the Ventana, there
to enter into the definitive treaties. They probably
hoped by some <i>ruse</i> to get the governor himself into
their hands, and were greatly disappointed at his
only sending his second in command, General
Rondeau, to treat with them. Rondeau marched
into their territory with a force of 1000 men, passing
to the west of the Tinta mountains, and, after
going some distance, was met by the principal Caciques,
with a large assemblage of their fighting
men; and here commenced a negociation, in which
the Buenos Ayrean general was fairly outwitted.
The Indians, affecting distrust, proposed that some
officers of consequence should be sent to them as
hostages during the conferences, offering, on their
part, to place some of their principal Caciques in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the power of the general. Rondeau fell into the
snare, and took his measures so badly, that, before
the exchange was made, his officers were suddenly
made prisoners, and carried off at a gallop,
enveloped by a cloud of Indians, who were soon
out of sight. His cavalry was in no condition to
follow the savages into the pampas, and he returned
to the Tandil with the conviction that the
Puelches tribes, as well as the Ranqueles, were
combined in one and the same determination to
have no more friendly intercourse with the Christians.</p>

<p>After this affair nothing further was attempted,
except to send out a party to explore the continuation
of the range of the Tandil to the coast, of
which the following was the result.</p>

<p>It has been already said that the range of the
Tandil gradually declines to the eastward till broken
by a wide vale, which commences about twelve miles
from the new fortification; the vale in question extends
for a distance of forty-two miles:&mdash;many streams
run through it, some few of which, inclining towards
the coast, fall into the sea, though the greater
part of them are lost in swamps in the low lands
which intervene. It is the greatest break in the
chain, and, from its rich pastures, a favourite resort
of the Indians. They call it the Vuulcan, which
signifies, in their language, an opening; and thence
the sierra, which bounds it to the eastward, also
takes its name. In many maps it is written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Volcan, which has led to the erroneous idea of
there being a volcano in those parts.</p>

<p>From the Vuulcan the range runs in a continuous
line for thirty-six miles towards the sea, presenting,
for the most part, towards the north the appearance of
a steep dyke or wall. On the summits are extensive
ranges of table-land, well watered, and with good
pasturage, to which the Indians, who are well acquainted
with the craggy ravines which alone lead
to them, are in the habit of driving their horses and
cattle, knowing that the nature of the ground requires
but little care to prevent their straying. At
a short distance from the coast the hills break off
in stony ridges, running down to the sea, and forming
the headland of Cape Corrientes, in latitude 38&deg;
6&acute;, and further south a line of rocky cliffs, which
bounds the shore as far as Cape Andres.</p>

<p>Upon the borders of a lake a short distance from
Cape Corrientes were discovered the remains of the
settlement formed by the Jesuits in the year 1747,&mdash;a
site chosen with all their characteristic sagacity, well
suited for an agricultural establishment, of easy access
to the sea, and with great capability of being
rendered defensible. It is a striking proof of the
indomitable nature of the pampas tribes that all
the efforts of the missionary fathers to reduce them
to habits of order and industry only ended in disappointment,
and, after years of fruitless endeavours,
to their being obliged to fly from an establishment
where their lives were no longer safe. The Indians of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the pampas, like the Arabs of the desert, inseparable
from their horses, and wild as the animals they ride,
were not, like the more docile people of Paraguay,
to be subjected to the strict rules and discipline
which it was the object of the fathers to introduce
amongst them. The vestiges of their buildings, and
the fruit-trees planted by them, are the only evidences
remaining of their pious but unavailing
labours.</p>

<p>Although this spot was in many respects a very
inviting one for an agricultural settlement, it wanted
the principal requisite of some tolerable roadstead
or harbour to facilitate any direct communication
from Buenos Ayres by sea with the new line of
frontier, an object of great importance if possible
to secure. The coast was vainly explored in search
of one from Cape Corrientes some way to the
south, and to the north as far as the great lake
called the Mar-chiquita, which empties itself into
the sea by a narrow channel, capable, perhaps, of
being deepened by artificial means, so as to form
a harbour for small vessels; but even this seemed
extremely doubtful, and depending on a further examination
and survey, which the officers were not at
the time prepared to undertake.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it was thought advisable
to postpone the construction of any further
works till a more accurate survey of the coast should
be made. This was subsequently commenced, and
carried as far as Bahia Blanca, which was re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>ported
to be the only situation from the Salado on
all the line of coast intervening which combined a
tolerable harbour for shipping with the capability of
being made a good defensible position. Although
this was far beyond the line of frontier at first contemplated,
which only reached to the range of the
Vuulcan and Tandil, other considerations eventually
determined the government of Buenos Ayres to extend
their boundary to that point. Not only did it
appear that Bahia Blanca was the only place capable
of being made a harbour on the coast, but the
want of some such harbour to the south became
more than ever apparent when the war broke out
with Brazil, and the River Plate was placed under
blockade by the emperor's fleet; and, although that
war at first necessarily diverted the attention of the
government of Buenos Ayres from the completion
of their original plan, it forced upon them a more
enlarged view of their position, and led to the final
adoption of an infinitely better boundary-line than
that which was first thought of merely as a check
upon the Indians.</p>

<p>The line in question, which was finally adopted
in 1828, and which forms the present nominal frontier
of the province of Buenos Ayres towards the
pampas, will be found upon the map drawn about
north-north-east, from the fort built on the river
Naposta, which falls into Bahia Blanca, to the Laguna
Blanca, another point occupied as a military
position, at the western extremity of the range of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Tapalquen; thence it runs north by the fort of Cruz
de Guerra to Melinqu&eacute;, the north-west point of the
province. It will be obvious, on reference to the map,
that, whilst this line embraced within it an infinitely
greater extent of country than that at first projected,
it was in reality, being straight, a shorter one, and
required less defences than the ranges of the Tandil
and Vuulcan, supposing all the passes to be fortified.</p>

<p>The whole area of the territory within this line
and the Arroyo del Medio, which separates the
province of Buenos Ayres to the northward from
that of Santa F&eacute;, comprises about 75,000 square
English miles.</p>

<p>The Indians would listen to no terms of accommodation,
and fought for their lands; whilst,
unfortunately for the people on the frontier, the
civil dissensions which broke out at the close of
the Brazilian war once more drew off the forces
of the government, and exposed them to the inroads
of the savages, before the fortifications on the
frontier could be completed and sufficiently garrisoned
for their defence. The devastation they committed
in consequence was frightful; but it was signally
avenged in 1832 and 1833 by General Rosas,
who, at the head of the largest force that ever entered
their territory, marched southward as far as the rivers
Colorado and Negro, scoured the whole intervening
country, and put thousands of them to death. Many
tribes were totally exterminated, and others fled to
the Cordillera of Chile, where alone they were safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
from the pursuit of the exasperated and victorious
soldiers.</p>

<p>That the Buenos Ayreans had ample cause for
these hostilities may be judged from the number
of Christian slaves whom they succeeded in
rescuing from the hands of the savages; upwards of
1500 women and children were retaken by General
Rosas' troops, who had all been carried off in some
or other of their marauding incursions, their husbands,
sons, and brothers having been in most instances
barbarously butchered before them. Many
of these poor women had been in their hands for
years; some taken in infancy could give little or
no account to whom they belonged; others had
become the wretched mothers of children brought
up to follow the brutal mode of life of these barbarians.
General Rosas fixed his head-quarters
on the river Colorado, midway between Bahia
Blanca and the settlement of Carmen on the
river Negro. Thence he detached a division of
his forces, under General Pacheco, to the south,
which established a military position on the Choleechel,
now called Isla de Rosas, on the Negro,
which river was followed to the junction of the
Neuquen. Another detachment marched under the
orders of General Ramos along the banks of the
Colorado as far as latitude 36&deg; and 10&deg; longitude
west of Buenos Ayres, according to his computation,
from whence he saw the Cordillera of the Andes
and believed he was not more than thirty leagues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
from Fort Rafael on the Diamante. Unfortunately
not the slightest sketch was made of the course
of this river, respecting which, therefore, we have
no new data beyond a corroboration of the accounts
obtained by Cruz, in 1806, of its being a
great river, which runs without interruption direct
from the Cordillera to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Of the Negro,
General Pacheco has been kind enough to send me
a sketch, which strikingly confirms the general
course of the river as laid down by Mr. Arrowsmith,
from Villari&ntilde;o's diary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

GEOLOGY OF THE PAMPAS.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Geological Features of the Southern compared with those of the
Northern Shore of the Plata. The Pampa Formation, probably
derived from the Alluvial Process now going on, as exhibited in
the Beds of the Plata itself and other Rivers. Fossil remains
of land Animals found in it, above Marine Shells. Such
Shells where met with, and of what Species. Mr. Bland's
Theory of the Upheaval of the Pampas from the Sea, founded
on the Deposits of Salt in them:&mdash;The presence of such Salt
may be otherwise accounted for. Account of the Discovery of
the Gigantic Fossil remains sent to England by the Author.</p></div>


<p>I cannot leave the pampas without a few words
upon their geological features, and upon the remarkable
contrast exhibited in the appearance of
the country on the northern and on the southern
shores of the Plata. On the north side the formation
is of clay-slate, gneiss, and granite, of which
the islands in the river above Buenos Ayres are
also composed, particularly Sola, Las Hermanas,
and Martin Garcia, where the granite is quarried
for the pavement of the city. On the southern side
every trace of rock is entirely lost, and for hundreds
of miles inland not even the smallest pebble is to be
met with.</p>

<p>As far as we are yet acquainted with it, the
whole of that vast level called the pampas, reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
from the eastern terminations of the Andes to the
shores of the Plata, appears to be one immense bed
of alluvium tranquilly deposited during the imperceptible
lapse of ages; the delta perhaps, not of one,
but of numerous rivers, originating in a once more
general diffusion of the waters from the Andes
before their courses were defined by their present
channels. Some such process of formation appears
still to be going on in many parts of the pampas,
where muddy streams and streamlets, the collections
from the mountains in the south and of the rainy
seasons, too sluggish to force a way through the
level country, inundate the plains, and gradually
deposit the alluvial sediment, together with a prodigious
quantity of decomposed vegetable matter, in
the swamps and morasses, until accumulations of
fresh soil take place in sufficient quantity to throw
off the waters again in some other direction. The
bed of the Plata, itself the reservoir of a hundred
rivers, is, from all I could learn, gradually silting
up, and, wide as it is at the present day, along its
shores, and particularly above Buenos Ayres, may
be distinctly traced the evidences of the waters
having once occupied a bed of infinitely greater
extent. Every observation tends to the inference
that this now mighty estuary may, centuries hence,
be reduced to similar bounds and rules to those
which govern the outlets of the Amazons, the
Mississippi, the Nile, and the Ganges. Nor will
this require, perhaps, so long a period as might at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
first be imagined.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> If we except the narrow channel
between the Chico and Ortiz banks, below Buenos
Ayres, the average depth of the river between that
city and Monte Video does not exceed twenty feet.
The prodigious quantity of mud and detritus brought
down by it is well known,&mdash;the whole river, wide
as it is, is at times discoloured by it. Now, if but
enough of this sediment is deposited to cause the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
small annual increase of only half an inch in the
bed of the river, it will not require 500 years to
form a delta, which, in the language of the country,
will be nothing more or less than an extension of
the existing pampas.</p>

<p>Such, I conceive, may have been the origin of
the far spread formation of the present pampas or
plains, throughout which are to be found the fossil
remains of gigantic animals of long lost species,
such as the megatherium and mastodon, and other
monsters yet unnamed, which in former ages may
have grazed upon the abundant pastures produced
in the rich loamy lands saved from the waters;
whilst beneath, in strata of marine shells, are no
less incontestable evidences of the ancient bed of the
ocean.</p>

<p>It cannot be expected that, in a country so uniformly
level as the pampas, sections of sufficient
depth will frequently occur to exhibit the underlying
strata. They must be looked for at the outlying
extremities of the formation, where the upper
bed thins out,&mdash;to use a geological term. Now
there is nothing that I know of to interrupt the
uniformity of the stratum between the southern
shore of the Plata on the one side, and the eastern
base of the Andes on the other, and at both these
extremes marine remains are strikingly exhibited.</p>

<p>General Cruz, in his journey from Antuco to
Buenos Ayres (noticed in chapter viii.), in passing
through the valleys in the lower ranges of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Cordillera, immediately before reaching the pampas,
was exceedingly struck with the abundance of marine
remains thereabouts. He says, in his diary,
"In all the hills and valleys under the Cordillera,
as far as the river Chadileubu, a great quantity of
marine remains are met with, some of them constituting
a sort of limestone. Not only may these
remains be observed upon the surface, but also at
great depths below it, in the sections formed by
the torrents as they descend from the mountains:
there can, therefore, be no doubt that the waters
of the sea once occupied the place of the land in
those parts."</p>

<p>Proceeding eastward, by the base of the mountain
ranges of San Luis and Cordova, which bound the
pampas to the north, we have the testimony of
water-worn rocks and beds of shells in that direction,
from Schmitmeyer, Helms, and other travellers,
at Portezuela and on the banks of the
Tercero; and beyond the Sierra de Cordova, on the
great river Paran&atilde;, near Santa F&eacute;, Mr. Darwin
found in the cliff which skirts the river a stratum of
marine shells distinctly exposed a little above the
level of the water, and with the alluvial bed over
it, forty or fifty feet thick, containing bones of extinct
mammalia.</p>

<p>Here, then, I think, we may trace, all but continuously,
the northern and western shores of a
gulf, which must have been nearly as large as that
of Mexico, and not very unlike it, perhaps, in ge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>neral
outline. Travelling south from Santa F&eacute;,
along the shores of the Plata, which bounds these
pampas on the east, we find, at distances varying
from one to six leagues inland from the river, and
from fifty to one hundred and fifty miles from the
sea, large beds of marine shells, which the people
of those parts quarry for lime. From these deposits
I have myself specimens of <i>Voluta Colocynthis</i>,
<i>Voluta Angulata</i>, <i>Buccinum Globulosum</i>, <i>Buccinum
Nov. Spe.</i>, <i>Oliva Patula</i>; <i>Cyther&aelig;a Flexuosa</i>?
<i>Mactra</i>? <i>Venus Flexuosa</i>, <i>Ostrea</i>, &amp;c. In some
places these shells are so compact as to form a sort
of limestone, easily worked when first dug out, and
hardening afterwards on exposure to the air. The
church of Magdalena upon the coast is built of this
material. They are generally in good preservation, and
some of the species appear almost identical with those
found upon the coasts of Brazil; others, on the contrary,
found with them are not known. There is
one, found generally by itself, unmixed with others,
which is particularly interesting on this question, as
strikingly proving the gradual growth of the
pampas; it is the small <i>mya</i>, named <i>potamo-mya</i> by
Sowerby, usually found in estuaries at the junction
of the fresh and salt water, and the existing type of
which is now to be met with at the mouth of the
Plata; but the bed from which my fossil specimens
were taken is at the Calera de Arriola, to the north
of Buenos Ayres, nearly 150 miles from its present
habitat; and there (I think manifestly proved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
these little shells) must have been once the mouth of
the mighty estuary, which is now more than 150
miles below it.</p>

<p>I must not omit to state that all these marine
deposits are found in situations more or less above
the present level of the ocean; this, in the neighbourhood
of the Cordillera, which is so continually
liable to volcanic disturbances, may be accounted
for; but it leads to other speculations in the flat
alluvial plains towards the Plata, where the phenomenon
of an earthquake is utterly unknown, and
where the apparently perfect horizontality of the
strata would seem to negative the idea of any violent
action by which it might have been upheaved.</p>

<p>Mr. Bland, one of the North American Commissioners
sent to Buenos Ayres in 1818, reasoning upon
the quantity of saline matter found in the pampas,
hazards, as he says, the conjecture that the pampa
formation "may have been gently lifted just above
the level of the ocean, and left with a surface so
unbroken and flat as not yet to have been sufficiently
purified of its salt and acrid matter, either by filtration
or washing:" and undoubtedly such saline
matter does exist very extensively over this formation.
Many of the running waters, as their names
denote, are rendered brackish by it; and lakes which
have no outlet become saturated with it, and deposit
it in regular beds, where in the dry season it may be
collected in any quantity. But it does not necessarily
follow that it has been left there by the ocean:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
we know that salt abounds in the Andes, and that
extensive beds of it occur, particularly in those parts
of them from which we may conjecture that the
greater part of the waters of the pampas are derived;
and if for a moment we can suppose the pampas
themselves to have originated in sedimentary deposits
from those mountain chains, we must I think
equally admit that the alluvial soil washed down
can hardly fail to be impregnated with so soluble a
substance as the salt which abounds in them. In a
country of more varied surface we might expect the
briny particles to be carried off by the streams and
lost in the sea; but in the dead levels of the pampas
the greater part of the streams themselves are lost
long ere they reach the ocean. The waters deposit
their sediment over the surface, and the salt is left
to amalgamate with the mire of the marshes, until
perhaps again the rains collect it, and either partially
carry it off in brackish streams, or deposit it in the
basins of the inland lakes, in which it is so abundantly
found. That it is a superficial deposit I think
is proved by the fact that (as elsewhere noticed) in
the immediate vicinity of some of the saline lakes
and rivers in the pampas, and where the surface of
all the surrounding country appears to be incrusted
with salt, the people dig wells, and find perfectly
fresh and potable water, as I understand, at a depth
of from twenty to fifty feet. The same may be said
to occur throughout the city of Buenos Ayres, where
all the wells which do not penetrate the <i>tosca</i> pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>duce
water more or less brackish, whilst those which
go below it are sweet. Some of the best water I
ever tasted was from a well sunk in the sandy
stratum below the clay at Mr. Brittain's quinta outside
the city. Further, I imagine that the discovery
of the remains of land animals so generally throughout
this formation is in itself conclusive of its deposition
<i>subsequently</i> to the existence of the ocean in
those parts, the ancient bed of which it must very
considerably overlie.</p>

<p>To speak of the megatherium alone, its remains
have been found in all parts of the pampas, from the
river Carcara&ntilde;a, in the province of Santa F&eacute;, to
the south of the Salado, a distance of nearly 300
miles in a direct line, and in all the intermediate
country. Such remains are much more common
than is supposed, and I am satisfied might frequently
be met with if searched for during the dry season,
or after long droughts, either in the banks of the
rivers, or in the beds of some of the numerous lakes
which are then dried up. All the remains I sent
home were so discovered, and so were those sent to
Madrid by the Marquis of Loreto, which were found
in the bed of the river Luxan, a short distance to
the north of the city of Buenos Ayres. The great
skeleton I obtained was discovered in the river
Salado, to the south of Buenos Ayres, after a
drought of unusually long continuance, by a peon
in the service of the Sosa family, who, attempting
to cross the river at an unfrequented spot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
was struck by the appearance of a large mass of
something standing above the surface of the water,
and which, supposing at first to be some part of
the trunk of a tree, he determined to get out if
possible: in this he was assisted by some of his
brother peons, who, throwing their lassoes over it,
succeeded in dragging it out, fortunately without
injury, for it proved to be nearly the entire pelvis of
the megatherium: with it were also brought up
several of the other bones, and amongst them some
of the vertebr&aelig;. To the peons the pelvis luckily
appeared to be useless: turn it which way they
would, they all agreed that it did not make half so
comfortable a seat as either a bullock's or a horse's
head; but the vertebr&aelig; did not so easily escape, and
in a place where not a stone is to be seen, were
eagerly seized upon as excellent substitutes to boil
their camp-kettles upon. The smaller ones being
best suited to the purpose were the first to disappear,
which may account for the deficiency of all
the cervical vertebr&aelig; as well as of many of the
smaller bones of the feet and other parts. After a
time it was suggested that the pelvis and some of
the largest bones should be sent as curiosities to the
owner of the estancia on which they were found,
Don Hilario Sosa, at whose house in Buenos Ayres
I first saw them. He was good enough, seeing my
great anxiety to obtain possession of them, after
exhibiting them to his friends, to place them at my
disposal, and to allow me to send people to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
estancia to search for the remainder of the skeleton:
by their exertions many other portions of it were
saved; and but for the destruction of some by the
country-people, as described, and of others which,
having been taken out in the first instance, had remained
exposed for some months to the sun, and
had become so brittle in consequence as not to bear
removal, the skeleton would have been tolerably
perfect. As it is, it was very fortunate that amongst
the parts preserved were some of those which are
wanting in the skeleton at Madrid, especially the
bones of the tail, which singularly corroborate the
anticipations of Cuvier, whose description of this
remarkable monster was drawn from a representation
of that specimen, the only one known to exist
till mine reached Europe.</p>

<p>M. Cuvier was not I believe aware of the grounds
which now exist for supposing that the animal was
covered with a coat of mail, like the armadillo, which
has led other comparative anatomists to ally it to that
family. There were no remains of such a shell appertaining
to the specimen at Madrid, neither were
any found with the bones which I have spoken of as
discovered in the Salado. Portions, however, of a
shelly covering in a fossil state, which must have
belonged to some gigantic animal, had been at
various times dug up in the pampas, which had excited
the attention and speculations of the curious.
Even father Falkner in his account of the country
speaks of them:&mdash;he says, that he himself found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
shell of an animal composed of little hexagonal bones,
each bone an inch in diameter at least, and the whole
shell nearly three yards over: it seemed to him to
be in all respects, except its size, the upper part of
the shell of an armadillo.</p>

<p>The researches I set on foot after finding the skeleton
in the Salado led to fresh discoveries, which, if
they do not identify these shells with the megatherium,
must lead us to conclude that these regions were once
inhabited by other gigantic animals no less extraordinary.
When the country-people saw the eagerness
with which the big bones from the Salado were
sought for, they were not backward in speaking of
other places where similar remains had been met
with, and were still, as they believed, to be found.
Upon this information I once more despatched my
agent to the south of the Salado, and the governor,
Don Manuel Rosas, taking an interest in the matter,
was good enough to furnish him with a letter of
recommendation to the local authorities, desiring
them to give him not only protection, but every
assistance he might need to ensure his success. In
little less than three weeks we were repaid by
the discovery of two more enormous skeletons on
the estancias of the governor himself, called Villanueva
and Las Averias, and in both instances with
the novelty of their being encased in a thick coating
or shell resembling that of the armadillo. The first,
found at Villanueva, though still of gigantic proportions,
appears to have been very much smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
than that which had been taken out of the Salado:
it was discovered in the bed of a small rivulet, and
upon exposure to the air nearly all crumbled to
dust. The only portions it was possible to preserve
being part of a scapula, a small portion of the jaw
with one small but perfect tooth remaining in it,
and a fragment of a hind leg, with some of the feet
bones. The shell lay, as Mr. Oakley, my agent,
described it, a little below the principal mass of the
bones, looking like the section of a huge cask; the
form of it when first discovered appeared natural
and perfect, but it would not bear to be lifted out
of its bed, and broke into small pieces and crumbled
away immediately.</p>

<p>From the account given by Mr. Oakley, and the
apparent resemblance of the remains of this specimen
to those previously discovered, although of a much
smaller size, I was induced to believe that they belonged
to a younger animal of the same species;
other persons, however, who have since had an opportunity
of comparing them with recent specimens
of the dasypus family, have suggested that it is more
probable that they belonged to a gigantic armadillo.
Such is the belief entertained, I am told, at Paris,
where casts of the bones in question have been sent.
The other skeleton, found at Las Averias, was described
to be as large as that of the megatherium.
It lay in a bed of hard clay, on the side of the lake
of Las Averias, partly exposed to view by the action
of the water against it in stormy weather. Here a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
large portion of the shell appeared in a perfect state,
and the country people, who took Mr. Oakley to the
spot, assured him that, when first discovered, it was
at least twelve feet in length, and from four to six
in depth. It was very hard, but could not be got
out whole. Mr. Oakley, however, brought away
some considerable portions of it, which, in this
instance, became harder the longer they were exposed
to the external air. Not so the bones within,
which, like those at Villanueva, almost immediately
mouldered away on being taken out of the earth. A
very imperfect fragment of the pelvis only reached
Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>On my return to England I exhibited these remains
at the Geological Society, and afterwards
made them over to the Royal College of Surgeons,
whose collection of comparative anatomy is by far
the finest in this country. Mr. Clift, the curator of
that collection, undertook to describe them, and his
paper upon them will be found in the "Transactions
of the Geological Society for 1835." Casts of
them, which were made at my desire, were also
deposited in other museums, abroad as well as at
home. Sir Francis Chantrey was kind enough to
superintend the making of them, and to a simple
suggestion of his, a solution of linseed-oil and
litharge,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> with which they were very thoroughly saturated,
may be ascribed their restoration to a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
hardly to be distinguished from that of the most
recent bone.</p>

<p>Dr. Buckland, the learned professor of geology
at Oxford, has since made the megatherium the
subject of a chapter in his "Bridgewater Treatise,"
wherein he has fully described the remarkable
peculiarities of its structure, in which, as he observes,
it exceeds its nearest living congeners in a
greater degree than any other known fossil animal.
With the head and shoulders of a sloth, it combined,
in its legs and feet, an admixture of the characters
of the ant-eater, the armadillo, and the chlamyphorus:
the latter it probably still further resembled
in being cased with a bony coat of armour. Measuring
the bones only, its haunches were more
than five feet wide;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> its thigh bone was twice the
thickness of that of the largest elephant; the fore
foot was a yard in length, and terminated by a
gigantic claw; the tail, the width of the upper part
of which was at least two feet, and which was probably
clad in armour, must have been infinitely
larger than that of any other known beast, amongst
extinct or living mammalia. The whole body, ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>cording
to the learned professor's calculations, was
about eight feet in height, and twelve in length.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
The annexed plate, carefully drawn from the original
bones, under Mr. Clift's superintendence, will serve
not only to give a general idea of the strange structure
of this extraordinary monster, but to show the
parts which are still wanting to make up the specimen.
I will only add that, if any of those parts
should fall into the hands of a casual collector, he
will render a service to science by transmitting them
to the curator of the College of Surgeons in London.</p>

by the historians of the first discoveries of those parts,
there is no instance, that I am aware of, mentioned by them of a
shipwreck in the river below San Gabriel, the port to which all

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

OF THE RIVERS PARAGUAY, PARANA, AND URUGUAY.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Importance of the rivers of the United Provinces. The Paraguay
and its tributaries. The Pilcomayo. The Vermejo. Soria's expedition
down it from Oran, proving it navigable thence to
Assumption. Periodical inundations of the Paran&atilde;, similar to
those of the Nile. The Uruguay and its affluents. Surveys by
the Commissioners appointed to determine the Boundaries laid
down by the Treaty between Spain and Portugal of 1777.
Original Maps obtained.</p></div>


<p>Before proceeding to give any account of the
Upper Provinces, a brief description will perhaps
here not be out of place of the great rivers which
form so remarkable a feature in the physical geography
of this part of the South American continent,
and from the navigation of which by steam-vessels
hereafter such important political consequences
may be anticipated.</p>

<p>Of these, the Paraguay is the first. This river,
which from Corrientes takes the name of Paran&atilde;,
has its sources between south lat. 13&deg; and 14&deg;, in
those ranges which, though of very trifling elevation
themselves, appear to connect the lofty mountains
of Peru and Brazil, and to constitute the water-shed
of some of the principal rivers of South America.
From their northern declivities descend some of the
most important of the eastern affluents of the Madera,
the Tapajos, and other great streams which empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
themselves into the Maranon, or Amazons; whilst,
on the other hand, all those which pour down towards
the south find their way into the bed of the
wonderful river I am describing.</p>

<p>Many navigable streams join it from the eastward,
as it passes through the rich Brazilian territories of
Matto Grosso and Cuyab&aacute;. Its tributaries from the
opposite side are, though perhaps more important,
less numerous, the surface of the country being more
level; of these the Jaur&uacute; is the first of any consequence,
the sources of which are close to those of the
Guapor&eacute;, which runs in the opposite direction into
the Madera and Amazons. The short portage which
intervenes between the heads of these rivers is all that
breaks a continuous water-course from the mouths of
the Amazons to that of the Plata, as will be seen
on reference to the map. A little below the Jaur&uacute;
commences a wide region of swamps called the
lake or lakes of Xarayes; which, during the periodical
inundations of the rivers that descend from
the mountains to the north of Cuyab&aacute;, is flooded for
a vast extent, the waters forming one great inland
sea, to the depth of ten or twelve feet, extending
between 200 and 300 miles east and west, and
upwards of 100 from north to south. As the rainy
season passes away, this mass of waters is finally
carried off by the Paraguay, which even here, 1200
miles in a direct line from the sea, is navigable for
vessels of 40 or 50 tons. The mouth of the Jaur&uacute;
is in 16&deg; 25&acute; long. 320&deg; 10&acute; east of Ferro:&mdash;here a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
marble pyramid is erected to mark the boundary
determined upon between the Spaniards and Portuguese
by the treaty of 1750.</p>

<p>Quiroga, who accompanied Flores, the Spanish
commissioner, to determine this point, in descending
the Paraguay fixed the latitude of most of the numerous
rivers which fall into it before its junction
with the Paran&atilde;.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> On the eastern side they afford
the means of communication with the gold and
diamond districts of Brazil, and lower down with
those districts of Paraguay proper which abound in
the finest timber, and produce the yerba mat&eacute;, the
article perhaps most in demand of all the rich productions
of that favoured country.</p>

<p>From the west its most important affluents are the
Pilcomayo and the Vermejo, which fall into it below
Assumption:&mdash;both flow through a prodigious extent
of country, having their sources in the rich districts
of Upper Peru. The first passes not far from Potosi,
and, after a thousand windings through the chaco,
or desert, falls into the Paraguay by two branches,
the one called the Araquay, in lat. 25&deg; 21&acute; 29",
according to an observation taken by Azara; the
other, about nine leagues below it. M. de Angelis
has I think clearly shown that the river to the
north of Assumption, which Azara has laid down as
the most northern branch of the Pilcomayo, is the
Fogones of Quiroga.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1741 Father Casta&ntilde;ares attempted an exploration
of the Pilcomayo, in the expectation that it would
facilitate a communication with the Jesuit missions
in the province of Chiquitos; but after many hardships
and difficulties, at the end of eighty-three days,
he was obliged to give it up, from the river becoming
too shallow for his canoes to pass on. In 1785
Azara attempted to ascend it by the Araquay, in
a small vessel; but after proceeding about twenty
leagues, was obliged to return, for the same reason,&mdash;want
of water; although it was at the season of the
floods, and the river was more than ordinarily full.</p>

<p>The Vermejo, on the contrary, which falls into the
Paraguay still further down, has been more than
once proved to afford a navigable communication
with the province of Salta: First by Cornejo, in
1790; who, starting from the confluence of the
rivers Centa and Tarija, reached the Paraguay in
fifty-five days; the distance by the river being,
according to his computation, no less than 407&frac12;
leagues. And more recently, in 1826, by Don
Pablo Soria, the agent of some spirited individuals
in Buenos Ayres, who about that time formed an
association for the purpose of endeavouring to open
a water-communication between the capital and the
rich districts of the Upper Provinces. The vessel
they built for the purpose was fifty-two feet long,
and drew about two feet water; which, with but
little more assistance than was necessary to keep
in the mid-stream, was floated down from the neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>bourhood
of Oran by the current, and in fifty-seven
days entered the Paraguay, without any other impediment
than a feeble attempt on the part of some
Indians, armed with bows and arrows, to annoy them
as they passed through their lands.</p>

<p>Once in the Paraguay, the main object of the
voyage was accomplished. Unfortunately, however,
for the adventurers themselves, they were there
seized upon by Dr. Francia, the despotic ruler of
that country, who, worse than the savages, detained
them for five years.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> He also deprived them of
their papers; and thus the details of a most interesting
voyage were lost, although the great and
highly important fact was established beyond dispute
of the existence of a safe and navigable water-communication
the whole way from Oran to Buenos
Ayres; a result which must sooner or later be of
immense consequence to the inhabitants of the Upper
Provinces.</p>

<p>About thirty miles below the mouth of the Vermejo
the Paraguay is joined from the east by the
great river Paran&atilde;, which name it thence takes till
it is finally lost in the Rio de la Plata. This river,
rivalling in extent the Paraguay itself, rises in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
mountain-chains to the north-west of Rio de Janeiro,
in latitude 21&deg;. Turning first westward, and afterwards
towards the south, it is increased by several
large rivers, amongst which the most noted are the
Paranaiba, the Tiet&eacute;, the Paranapan&eacute;, and the Curitava.
On reaching the Guarani Missions, near Candelaria,
in about lat. 27&deg; 30&acute;, it turns again westward,
and runs with little deviation from that parallel
till it falls into the Paraguay. Thence these two
mighty rivers, mingling their waters flow on in
one vast and uninterrupted stream, gradually increased
by many rivers of minor importance, which
join it from either side, till they finally empty themselves
through a well-defined delta into the estuary
of La Plata.</p>

<p>The extent of the practicable navigation on the
two great branches of this mighty river varies with
the geological formation of the countries through
which they respectively pass.</p>

<p>The Paran&atilde;, whilst running through the mountainous
districts of Brazil, is broken by many falls
above the Guarani Missions, especially one called
the Salto Grande, in lat. 24&deg; 4&acute; 58" (as fixed by the
officers of the Boundary Commission in 1788),
where the river, which immediately before is nearly
a league across, becomes suddenly confined by a
rocky pass not more than sixty yards in width,
through which it rushes with inconceivable fury,
and forms a splendid cataract, between 50 and 60
feet high, dashing down with such thundering noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
that it is said to be heard at a distance of five or six
leagues. For a hundred miles afterwards, as far as
the mouth of the river Curitiba, in lat. 25&deg; 41&acute;, the
river is nothing but a succession of falls and rapids.</p>

<p>The Paraguay, properly so called, on the contrary,
may be passed up by vessels of some burthen
the whole way<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to the Jaur&uacute;, in latitude 16&deg; 25&acute;,
presenting the extraordinary extent of an uninterrupted
inland navigation of nearly nineteen degrees
of latitude, calculating the straight distance north
and south, throughout the whole of which there is
not a rock or stone to impede the passage, the
bottom being everywhere of clay or fine sand. The
least depth of water is in the channels through the
delta by which it discharges itself into the Plata, but
in the passage called the Guaz&uacute; (the great canal)
there is seldom less than two and a half fathoms.</p>

<p>The upper part of the river is extremely picturesque,
and its shores abound in all the varieties of
an intertropical vegetation. The palms particularly
are remarkable for the magnificence of their growth.
Below the junction of the Paran&atilde; it is thickly
studded with islands covered with wild orange-trees,
and a variety of beautiful shrubs and parasitical
plants, new to European eyes.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that there is a great resemblance
in the periodical risings and inundations of
the Paraguay and those of the Nile, and there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
certainly a striking analogy between the two rivers in
many respects. Both rise in the torrid zone, nearly
at the same distance from the equator, and both,
though holding their courses towards opposite poles,
disembogue by deltas in about the same latitude;
both are navigable for very long distances, and both
have their periodical risings, bursting over their
natural bounds, and inundating immense tracts of
country.</p>

<p>The Paran&atilde; begins to rise about the end of
December, which is soon after the commencement
of the rainy season in the countries situated between
the tropic of Capricorn and the equator, and increases
gradually till the month of April, when it
begins to fall something more rapidly until the
month of July. There is afterwards a second rising,
called by the natives the <i>repunte</i>; but this, though
regular, is of no great consequence, the river never
overflowing its banks. It is probably occasioned by
the swelling of the rivers from the winter rains in
the temperate zone.</p>

<p>The extent of these periodical risings is, of
course, in some degree, regulated by the quantity,
more or less, of rain which may fall during the
corresponding season; but, in general, the inundation
takes place with great regularity, the waters
rising gradually about twelve feet in the bed of the
river in four months; this is the ordinary average
of the increase of the river after its junction with
the Paraguay; though above it, at Assumption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
where the river is much confined, the rise is said to
be sometimes as much as five or six fathoms.</p>

<p>The year 1812 was remarkable for the greatest
flood in the memory of the natives. Vast quantities
of cattle were carried away by it, and when the
waters began to subside, and the islands which they
had covered became again visible, the whole atmosphere
for a time was poisoned by the effluvia from
the innumerable carcases of skunks, capiguaras,
tigers, and other wild beasts which had been
drowned on them. On such occasions it frequently
happens that the animals, to save themselves, swim
off to the floating masses of canes and brushwood
(called by the Spaniards "camelotes"), and are thus
carried down the river, and landed in the vicinity of
the towns and villages upon the coast. Many strange
stories, are told of the unexpected visits of tigers so
conveyed from their ordinary haunts to Buenos
Ayres and Monte Video. One in my time was
shot in my own grounds near Buenos Ayres, and
some years before no less than four were landed in
one night at Monte Video, to the great alarm of the
inhabitants when they found them prowling about
the streets in the morning. In the swampy region
of Xarayes, where the inundation commences, the
ants, which are in vast numbers there, have the
sagacity to build their nests in the tops of the trees,
far out of reach of the waters; and these nests are
made of a kind of adhesive clay, so hard that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
cement can be more durable or impervious to the
weather.</p>

<p>During the inundation the river is exceedingly
turbid, from the great quantity of vegetable substances
and mud brought down by it:&mdash;the velocity
of the stream in the higher and narrower parts of
the river at first prevents their deposition, but as it
approaches the lower lands, or pampas, where it
overflows its bed, these substances are spread over
the face of the land, forming a grey slimy soil,
which, on the abatement of the waters, is found to
increase vegetation in a surprising degree.</p>

<p>A calculation has been made by Colonel Monasterios,
author of an excellent paper on this river,
printed in the Statistical Register of Buenos Ayres
for 1822, that no less than 4000 square leagues of
country are annually covered by the waters during
the periodical inundations of the Paran&atilde;.</p>

<p>From the almost uninterrupted level of the
country which intervenes between the eastern ranges
of the Cordillera and the Paraguay, many rivers
which descend from them are either partially or
entirely lost, after long and tortuous meanderings,
in swamps and lakes, the waters of which are absorbed
by evaporation during the heats of summer.
This is strikingly exemplified in the river Pasages,
or Salado, which, from the great extent of its
course, and the many other streams it collects in its
long course from the province of Salta to Santa F&eacute;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
would be a river of the first importance, were not
the greater part of its waters lost in the level plains
through which it runs. The Dulce, which, passing
by Tucuman and Santiago, runs parallel to it, is
lost in the great lake called the Porongos, in the
pampas of the province of Santa F&eacute;. The Primero
and Segundo, which rise in the province of Cordova,
disappear in the same plains. The Tercero,
the most important river of that province, with
difficulty finds its way during part of the year to
the bed of the Carcara&ntilde;a, which falls into the
Paran&atilde;, near San Espiritu, below Santa F&eacute;. The
Quarto and the Quinto, and, still further south, the
waters of the rivers from Mendoza and San Luis,
are lost in the swamps and lakes which form so
striking a feature in the maps of that part of the
continent.</p>

<p>The Uruguay, which contributes with the Paran&atilde;
to form the great estuary of La Plata, takes its name
from the numerous falls and rapids which mark its
course. The whole extent of its course is little less
than 300 leagues. It rises in latitude 27&deg; 30&acute;, in
the mountains on the coast of Brazil, opposite the
island of St. Catharine's, and for a long distance
runs nearly due west, receiving, besides many rivers
of less importance, the Uruguay-Mini (or Little
Uruguay) from the south, and the Pepiry-Guaz&uacute; (or
Great Pepiry) from the north. As it approaches
the Paran&atilde; it changes its course, inclining southward
through the beautiful territories of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Jesuit Missions. Opposite to Yapey&uacute;, the last of
those establishments, it receives, in latitude 29&deg; 30&acute;,
the Ybicuy, a considerable stream from the east. In
30&deg; 12&acute; the Mirinay pours into it from the west a
great part of the drainage of the great lake or
swamp of Ybera. Its principal tributaries afterwards
are the Gualeguaych&uacute;, from the province of
Entre Rios, and the Negro, the largest river of the
Banda Oriental, soon after the junction of which
it falls into the Plata with the Paran&atilde;, in about
34&deg; south latitude. Flowing through a country the
geological formation of which totally differs from
that through which the Paraguay takes its course,
its navigation is broken by many reefs and falls,
only passable when the waters are at their highest,
during the periodical foods, or by portages in the
dry season. Of these the Salto Grande and Chico
(the great and small falls), a little below the 31&deg; of
latitude, are the first and worst impediments met
with in ascending the river. The former consists
of a rocky reef running like a wall across its bed,
which at low water is at times crossed by the
gauchos of the country on horseback, though during
the floods it is passable in boats, by which, and
canoes, the river is navigable without further danger
as high up as the Missions.</p>

<p>Beautiful specimens of silicified wood and variegated
pebbles are found in the upper parts of the
bed of this river, of which I brought many to this
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The Negro, which runs into it from the Banda
Oriental, derives its name (the black river) from
the sarsaparilla plant, which, at a particular season,
rots upon its banks, and falls into the stream in
such immense quantities as to discolour its waters,
which are found to be highly medicinal, and much
in request in consequence. The little village of
Mercedes, near its mouth, has of late years been
much resorted to by invalids from Buenos Ayres to
drink these waters.</p>

<p>The river Paraguay, as high as the Jaur&uacute;, was
carefully laid down after the treaty of 1750; and
the Spanish officers appointed to determine the
boundaries, in virtue of that subsequently signed in
1777, surveyed the Paran&atilde; as high as the Tiet&eacute;, as
well as the whole of the Uruguay, and determined
the courses of all their most important affluents in
the course of the eighteen years during which they
were employed in laying down the southern division
only of this survey. The results of their labours,
which were only stopped by the renewal of war, may
justly be ranked amongst the most beautiful and
perfect geographical works ever produced. Copies
of the whole existed at Buenos Ayres during my
time in the hands of Colonel Cabrer, one of the
officers originally attached to the commissioners;
and the Government of Buenos Ayres were in treaty
for the purchase of them for the use of the topographical
department of the state, where, it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
be hoped, they will not be buried in unprofitable
obscurity.</p>

<p>When the war with Brazil for the Banda Oriental
broke out, in 1826, Colonel Cabrer drew a MS. map
from these materials for the use of General Alvear,
the Buenos Ayrean Commander-in-chief, which he
was afterwards kind enough to present to me. By
a curious coincidence, about the same time, I obtained
possession of one upon a large scale of the southern
provinces of Brazil, drawn, by the Emperor's order,
from the best data to be collected at Rio de Janeiro,
for the Marquis of Barbacena, who commanded the
Brazilian army, and lost it at the battle of Ituzaingo.
They have, I believe, afforded Mr. Arrowsmith data
for materially improving his last maps of that part of
South America.</p>

<h3>PROVINCE OF SANTA F&Eacute;.</h3>

<p>The first discoverers of La Plata, as has been
already observed, fixed themselves in Paraguay, and
established the seat of their government at Assumption,
the capital of that province. In his way up
the river, Sabastian Cabot built a fort, called Sancti-Espiritu,
at the junction of the Carcar&atilde;na with the
Paran&atilde;; Ayolas, a few years after, built another
not far from it, to which he gave the name of Corpus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Christi; but these, like Mendoza's settlement at
Buenos Ayres, were very soon destroyed by the
warlike nations which then inhabited the whole of
the right bank of the river; and, for the first half-century,
with their views solely fixed on making a
nearer approach to Peru, the Spaniards concerned
themselves but little about the conquest of the
poorer lands they had left behind them. The ships,
which during that time continued to arrive in the
River Plate, with fresh adventurers from Spain,
with an inland navigation before them, to Assumption,
requiring as much time as the whole voyage
out from Europe, were entirely dependent for the
refreshments they required on the accidental good
will of the natives. Once in the Paran&atilde;, if any
accident befell them, for nearly a thousand miles
there was not a single Christian port in which they
could take refuge.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that Don Juan
de Garay, a Biscayan hidalgo (in 1573), who had
already greatly distinguished himself amongst his
companions at arms in those parts, solicited and
obtained permission to make a sally from Assumption,
to endeavour to re-establish Cabot's fort at the
mouth of the Carcar&atilde;na, and to found other settlements
upon the right bank of the Paran&atilde;.</p>

<p>The whole force he could muster for this enterprise,
when ready, consisted only of eighty men, a
small party wherewith to attempt to seize upon
lands defended by a numerous and warlike people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
already elated by former victories over the Spaniards,
though probably as large a one as his own
means would allow him to equip; for in those days
the whole charge of such undertakings devolved
upon the projectors:&mdash;they were obliged to raise
the means as they could, and their ultimate success
of course were mainly depended upon the extent of
their personal credit.</p>

<p>De Garay landed, in the first instance, with his
followers, thirty or forty miles to the north of the
river Salado, and, finding the natives disposed to be
friendly, and the aspect of the country inviting,
he determined there to make his first settlement,
naming it Santa F&eacute; de la Vera-Cruz.</p>

<p>The site originally fixed upon was where Cayest&aacute;
now stands, upon an inferior branch of the Paran&atilde;;
but, at a subsequent period, the Santa Fecinos removed
lower down to the banks of the Salado.</p>

<p>Whilst part of his people were employed upon
the works, De Garay embarked with the rest in a
small brig which attended him, and descending the
Paran&atilde; entered the Salado, and opened a communication
with the natives established upon its banks.
There an adventure attended him, which he little
looked for. Just as he flattered himself he had established
a friendly understanding with the Indians,
their conduct was observed suddenly to change:&mdash;a
great stir took place amongst them, and they began
to betake themselves, to their arms, and to gather together
in such numbers that the Spaniards, alarmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and expecting to be attacked by them, were glad to
get on board their little vessel, and make the best
preparations they could for defence. From the
mast-head fires were seen lighting in every direction,
the well-known signal for war; and the man
placed there to look out gave notice that the savages
were pouring down towards them in vast numbers,
not only by land, but by the river, in their canoes,
apparently to attack them in their ship.</p>

<p>De Garay, pent up in a little creek, into which
he had run his vessel, and believing his situation
desperate, was exhorting his people at any rate to
defend themselves to the last, when suddenly the
man called out that he saw a cavalier, presently
another, and another, and then several more, charging
the Indians in their rear; nor was it long before
they saw the whole host dispersed, routed, and flying
before a party of horsemen. The Spaniards were as
much astonished at this unlooked-for encounter as
the Indians, nor could they imagine to whom they
were thus indebted for their preservation at the
moment they expected to have been overwhelmed
without a chance of succour, though that they were
some of their countrymen they could not doubt after
seeing the horses.</p>

<p>The strangers were not long in making themselves
known; they were soldiers from Tucuman,
who, under their leader Cabrera, having founded the
city of Cordova on the same day that De Garay had
commenced his settlement at Santa F&eacute;, were then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
scouring the country to take possession of it as belonging
to his jurisdiction; De Garay in vain resisted
this pretension, and claimed it as belonging to
Paraguay, in right of prior possession and settlement:
the others insisting with a superior force,
he had no alternative but to temporise, and submit
himself to Cabrera's orders, trusting to the higher
powers to order the matter differently.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the settlement of this question ere
it led to more serious consequences, the Adelantado
Zarate opportunely arrived from Spain with a grant
from the King, explicitly including in his government
all settlements, which might be founded on
either shore of the river for the distance of 200
leagues: he not only confirmed De Garay in his
command at Santa F&eacute; but took him into such
especial favour, that, dying soon afterwards, he left
him guardian of his only daughter; she, by his advice,
married Don Juan de Vera and Arragon, who
in consequence succeeded to the Adelantasgo, which
greatly increased the influence of De Garay, who
was immediately appointed lieutenant over all the
Rio de la Plata, and furnished with full authority to
carry into effect his own plans for reducing the
Indians to subjection upon its shores. Armed with
these powers he conquered some of the most warlike
of the native tribes, and established the fame and
power of the Spaniards far and wide throughout all
those regions:&mdash;the last of his deeds was the foundation,
in 1580, of the present city of Buenos Ayres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
as has been before stated. Alter passing three years
in superintending the laying out of the future capital
of all those provinces, upon his return to Assumption,
going incautiously on shore one night to sleep,
he was surprised and killed by the savages. Paraguay
lost in him one of her wisest and most valiant
captains, whose death was greatly lamented, by the
poor especially, to whom his beneficence was unbounded.</p>

<p>The importance of the settlements he founded
was soon apparent; and in 1620 they were formed
into a government independent of that of Paraguay,
under the name of the Government of La Plata; it
comprised all south of the junction of the rivers
Paran&atilde; and Paraguay. Santa F&eacute; in consequence
became a dependency of Buenos Ayres; an arrangement
confirmed in every territorial settlement subsequently
made by any competent authority.</p>

<p>In the domestic dissensions, however, which
succeeded the establishment of the Independent Government
at Buenos Ayres, Santa F&eacute; took an active
part, and disputed the right of the newly-constituted
authorities to interfere in the nomination of the provincial
administrations. Under these circumstances,
in 1818, Lopez, a military officer who had particularly
distinguished himself in his resistance to the
Central Government upon this point, obtained the
command of the province, in which he has ever since
been continued. Various circumstances have concurred
to leave him not only in undisturbed posses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>sion
of this local authority, but to render him in later
times a personage of some importance in the political
history of the Republic. The jurisdiction he lays
claim to for the soi-disant province of Santa F&eacute; extends
as far south as the Arroyo del Medio, to the
west to the lakes of Porongos, and to the north as
far as the lands of the Indians of the Gran-chaco,
or Great Desert, against whom he has enough to do
to defend himself.</p>

<p>In old times Santa F&eacute; under the protection of the
Central Government, which spared no expense in constructing
forts and maintaining the forces requisite to
keep the Indians in check, was the central point of
communication not only between Buenos Ayres and
Paraguay, but between Paraguay and the provinces
of Cuyo and Tucuman: the wines and dried fruits of
Mendoza and St. Juan were brought there to be carried
up to Corrientes and Paraguay, which in return
supplied the people of those provinces, as well as
those of Chile and Peru, through the same channel,
with all the yerba-mat&eacute; they required, of which the
annual consumption in those provinces alone was
calculated at from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 lbs.</p>

<p>The <i>estancieros</i> were amongst the richest in the
Vice-Royalty; and their cattle-farms not only covered
the territory of Santa F&eacute;, but large tracts on the
eastern shores of the river in the Entre Rios; from
which they furnished by far the greater part of the
50,000 mules yearly sent to Salta for the service of
Peru.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Their situation is now a very different one: the
stoppage of the trade with Paraguay and Peru has
reduced them to a wretched state of poverty; and
their estrangement from the capital having left them
without adequate means of defence, the savages have
attacked them with impunity, laid waste the greater
part of the province, and more than once threatened
the town itself with annihilation.</p>

<p>The population has greatly diminished;&mdash;perhaps
in the whole province there are not now more than
15,000 or 20,000 souls, a large proportion of which
is of Guarani origin, the descendants of emigrants
from the Jesuit missions in Paraguay, who abandoned
them after the expulsion of their pastors in
1768.</p>

<p>This state of things is the more lamentable as
Santa F&eacute; might, under a different system, become
one of the most important points of the Republic:
once more under the decided protection of the
Government of Buenos Ayres, not only might its
own particular interests be vastly advanced, but the
greatest benefits might result to the rest of the
union.</p>

<p>Its situation offers striking facilities for carrying
on a more active transit-trade between Buenos Ayres
and the provinces north of Cordova. The river
Salado, on which it stands, is known to be navigable
for barges as high up as Matara, in the
province of Santiago, and at no great distance
from that city; if it were made use of there would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
be a saving of upwards of 250 leagues of land-carriage
in conveying goods from Buenos Ayres to
Santiago; but, even if this should turn out not to be
so practicable as it is said to be, a direct road is
open from Santa F&eacute; which, passing by the lakes of
Porongos, skirts the river Dulce, and falls into the
high road from Cordova a few posts south of the
city of Santiago; which, at the lowest computation,
would still be 100 leagues short of the over-land
route now used from the capital to the Upper Provinces
by way of Cordova.</p>

<p>In any part of the world such a saving of land-carriage
would be a considerable object; but in a
country where the roads are just as nature has
made them, and where the only means of transport
for heavy goods are the most unwieldy of primitive
waggons, drawn by oxen&mdash;the slowest of all conveyances,&mdash;not
to speak of its expense, and the
risks, independently of the wear and tear necessarily
attending it, it becomes of the greatest importance.
That it has not hitherto been available, is owing to
the difficulties attending the navigation of a large
river, not only against the current, but against a
prevalence of contrary winds, which have rendered
the passage of the Paran&atilde; up to Santa F&eacute; even more
tedious and expensive than the long over-land journey.
But the introduction of steam-boats would at once
obviate this, and enable the people of Buenos Ayres
to send their heaviest goods to Santa F&eacute; by water-carriage
in less time than a horse can now gallop over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the intervening country, for there is no reason in the
world why the ordinary voyage thither should exceed
at the utmost three days. I can hardly imagine a
greater change in the prospects of a people than this
would open to the Santa Fecinos.</p>

<p>There is, however, another point of view, of serious
consequence to Buenos Ayres, in which for her own
sake it concerns her to look to the advantages, if
not to the necessity, of taking speedy measures to introduce
steam-navigation upon the Paran&atilde;. Since
the erection of the Banda Oriental into an independent
state, the yearly imports into Monte Video
have increased out of all ratio to the scanty population
of that state:&mdash;it is very evident what becomes
of the excess, and that not only the people on the
eastern, but those on the western, shores of the
Uruguay, are supplied through that channel. The
government of Monte Video takes care so to regulate
its duties as to make this a profitable trade:&mdash;whilst
it cannot be denied that the inhabitants of
Entre Rios and Santa F&eacute; have quite as much right
to traffic with their neighbours as those of Mendoza
and Salta have to trade with Chile and Peru.</p>

<p>Buenos Ayres has already suffered a great loss of
revenue in consequence, and this loss will yearly
increase, to the great detriment of the national credit,
for which she is responsible, and to the still further
estrangement of the provinces from each other, unless
she takes active means to counteract the evil:&mdash;those
means are in her own hands. The intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>duction
of steam-navigation, by establishing a
cheaper communication between her own port and
the Littorine provinces, will soon put an end to
the profits of the over-land trade which is at present
carried on through the Banda Oriental. It
may, perhaps, be necessary, in the first instance, to
grant some remission of the ordinary duties, in the
shape of drawback or otherwise, upon goods reshipped
for other parts of the republic in steamers,
as well as upon all produce of the country received
by the same conveyance in exchange:&mdash;but, whatever
apparent sacrifice Buenos Ayres may make to
promote this object, she may be assured she will be
repaid a hundred-fold by the results.</p>

<p>If the confederation of these provinces is to be a
real one, and for joint benefit, they must pull together,
and help one another. They possess, in a singular
degree, within themselves, the means of mutual
aid and support, and, if properly applied, they can
hardly fail to insure them a great increase of individual
prosperity and national importance.</p>

<p>The reverse of the picture has been foretold in
words which no man can gainsay:&mdash;"<i>if a kingdom
be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot
stand.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>


<h3>PROVINCE OF ENTRE RIOS.</h3>

<p>The Entre Rios territory, bounded on three sides
by the Paran&atilde;, and on the east by the river Uruguay,
like Santa F&eacute;, formed part of the intendency
of Buenos Ayres till the year 1814, when the general
government divided it into two distinct provinces,
called the provinces of Entre Rios and Corrientes:&mdash;the
separating line between them, for the present
agreed upon, is that formed by the little river Guayquiraro,
which falls into the Paran&atilde; in about latitude
30&deg; 30&acute;, and the Mocoreta, which runs in the opposite
direction into the Uruguay.</p>

<p>The Villa del Paran&atilde;, or Bajada, opposite to
Santa F&eacute;, is, nominally, the capital town of Entre
Rios;&mdash;which province is subdivided by the river
Gualeguay into two departments, that of the Paran&atilde;
and that of the Uruguay.</p>

<p>According to the Provisional Reglamento or
Constitution drawn up in 1821, in imitation of that
of Buenos Ayres, the governor should be chosen
every two years by a provincial junta, composed of
deputies from the several towns or villages, the principal
of which, after the capital, are the Villa de la
Concepcion on the Uruguay; and Nogoya, Gualeguay,
and Gualeguaych&uacute;, on the rivers of the same name.</p>

<p>The population may be about 30,000 souls,&mdash;very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
much scattered,&mdash;and almost entirely occupied in
the estancias or cattle-farms, in which the wealth of
the province chiefly consists. Many of them belong
to capitalists in Buenos Ayres:&mdash;they have the advantages
of a never-failing supply of water, and of
being safe from any inroads of the Indians,&mdash;the
two great desiderata for such establishments in that
part of the world,&mdash;whilst their proximity to Buenos
Ayres ensures a ready sale for the produce.</p>

<p>These advantages made it a great cattle-country
in the time of the Spaniards, but it was devastated
and depopulated in the first years of the struggle for
independence by the notorious Artigas and his followers,
and became the scene of much bloodshed and
confusion:&mdash;from that it had hardly begun to recover
when the war, breaking out between the Republic
and Brazil for the Banda Oriental, again made it
the theatre, as a frontier province, of military operations,
and unsettled the habits of the population.
The years which have elapsed since the conclusion
of that war have sufficed once more to cover the province
with cattle, and there are gauchos enough to
take care of them.</p>

<h3>PROVINCE OF CORRIENTES.</h3>

<p>The population of the province of Corrientes in
1824 was estimated at from 35,000 to 40,000 inhabitants.
It is ruled by a governor elected by a
junta of deputies,&mdash;how they are chosen I know not.
His official acts are countersigned by a secretary,
and in law matters he is assisted by an officer
termed the assessor,&mdash;a point of form common, I
believe, to all the provincial administrations, and
derived from the practice of the intendents in the
time of the Spanish rule.</p>

<p>The city of Corrientes was begun in 1588, soon
after De Garay founded his settlements at Santa F&eacute;
and Buenos Ayres. Its position is in latitude 27&deg;
27&acute;, at the junction of the rivers Paran&atilde; and Paraguay,
and it may also be said of the Vermejo, the
mouth of which is not more than ten leagues distant
from it:&mdash;it affords, in consequence, every facility
for an active commercial intercourse with the most
remote parts of the republic. The natural productions
in these latitudes are similar to those of Brazil,
and cotton, tobacco, rice, sugar, indigo, and many
other articles of the first demand in the markets of
Europe, may be produced there in any quantity:&mdash;but
the same difficulties to which I have already alluded,
in speaking of the navigation of the Paran&atilde;, aggra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>vated
by increased distance, have hitherto prevented
the people of Corrientes from profiting, as might
have been expected, by these advantages, and have
checked all inducement to industry; although they
themselves, in their simplicity, ascribe the non-cultivation
of their lands to different causes:&mdash;they think,
with their neighbour Dr. Francia, that foreign ships
might just as well go to them as to Buenos Ayres,
and that they do not do so they ascribe to the policy
of the metropolitan government, which they ungratefully
reproach with refusing to throw open the navigation
of the river to foreign trade in order to
appropriate to their own purposes the revenue resulting
from it,&mdash;regardless of the fact that the
collection of those duties is the only means by which
Buenos Ayres can ever expect to discharge either
interest or capital of the heavy debts she has incurred
in securing the independence, and in since
upholding the honour and credit of the republic.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that it will always be the
true policy of the governors of Buenos Ayres to
render those duties as light as possible, and especially
to reduce, as far as they can, all charges upon
the native produce from the provinces of the interior;
but if they are to be placed, as they always have
been, and from their geographical position always
must be, in the vanguard of the republic, to bear the
brunt of foreign wars, and all those expenses which
must naturally arise out of their intercourse with
other nations, they can never give up their right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
avail themselves of the ordinary resources for meeting
such exigencies which are placed within their
reach.</p>

<p>If the expenses of the war with the mother country
for their independence, and afterwards of that
with Brazil for establishing that of the Banda
Oriental, could be fairly apportioned amongst the
population of the provinces, the people of Corrientes,
as well as of all other parts of the interior, would
soon see that the custom-house duties now levied
at Buenos Ayres which affect them would go but
little way to meet anything like the share of that
national expenditure which might be justly charged
against them.</p>

<p>It is, however, useless to enter into this discussion,
when the truth is, that, whether Buenos Ayres
chooses or not to declare the navigation of the
Paran&atilde; free, the people of Corrientes may rest assured
it will never answer to the shipping of foreign
nations to avail themselves of it:&mdash;foreigners will
purchase the productions of Corrientes and of Paraguay
if placed within their reach at low prices, but
they will not unnecessarily incur the risks and expenses
of sending their own ships a thousand miles
up a river against wind and tide, in quest of a cargo
which may at all times be had in the seaports of
Brazil.</p>

<p>Steam-communication will enable the Correntinos
to compete with the Brazilians, and it is perhaps
the only means by which they will be enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
find any sale for their produce at such a rate as will
make it worth the while of foreigners to seek for it,
even in the market of Buenos Ayres. They have
every facility for establishing it,&mdash;navigable rivers
communicating with the farthest extremes of the republic,&mdash;and
an endless abundance of wood of every
kind for fuel.</p>

<p>A remarkable physical feature in this province
is the great lagoon of Ybera, extending in width
about thirty leagues parallel to the course of the
Paran&atilde;, from which it is supposed to derive its
waters by some underground drainage, for no stream
runs into it. Spreading far and wide to the
south it occupies the enormous space of about a
thousand square miles, and supplies four considerable
rivers&mdash;the Mirinay, which runs into the Uruguay;
and the Santa Lucia, the Bateles, and the Corrientes,
which discharge themselves into the Paran&atilde;.
It was Azara's opinion, from the general aspect of the
country, that the Paran&atilde; itself at some former period
took its course through this lake, and might again
resume its ancient channel. At present it is hardly
possible to explore any part of it from the prodigious
quantity of aquatic plants and shrubs by which it is
for the most part covered.</p>

<p>What a store of lacustrine deposits is here forming
for the examination of future geologists!</p>

<p>Connected with this lake is the tradition, which
has been handed down by early Spanish writers, of
a nation of <i>pigmies</i> who were said to have lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
islands in the midst of it, a tale which the first discoverers,
who were generally as ignorant as they
were brave, seem to have as implicitly believed as
that a race of giants once occupied other parts of the
same continent.</p>

<p>Both tales are easily traceable to their true origin,
and neither of them is without a plausible foundation.</p>

<p>The bones of extinct animals of monstrous size,
so frequently met with, gave rise, as well they might,
to the story of the giants. The <i>pigmies</i> are a race
unfortunately not yet extinct, and are palpably the
<i>ants</i>, whose marvellous works (especially in the part
of the country I am speaking of), vying with those of
man himself, are no less calculated to have occasioned
at first sight, amongst credulous people,
the most far-fetched conjectures as to their origin.
I have made some allusion, in speaking of the course
of the river Paraguay, to their ingenious contrivances
in the lakes of Xarayes (where also the pigmy
tribes were said to have dwelt), but those are nothing
compared to the works of the ants of Corrientes
and Paraguay, where whole plains are said to
be covered with their buildings of dome-like and
conical forms, rising five and six feet and more in
height, and formed of a cement hard as a rock, and
impervious to the wet. Man's vanity might easily
prompt him to mistake them for works of his own
kind in miniature; but, all-presumptuous as he is,
nothing he has ever yet constructed in all the pleni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>tude
of his power is comparable to the works of these
little insects. The Pyramids of Egypt do not bear
one half the relative proportion to his own size which
the ordinary habitations of these ants do to theirs.</p>

<p>Their works under ground are no less extraordinary:
Azara has described with his usual minuteness
the various species which he fell in with. There
is one amongst others which is winged, and the
swarms of which are so prodigious, that he says he
rode for three leagues continuously through one of
them. This was in about the latitude of Santa F&eacute;,
where they particularly abound, and where the people
catch them and eat them. The hind parts it seems
are very fat, and they fry them into a sort of paste
or omelette, or, mixed up with sugar, make sweetmeats
of them.</p>

<p>They are a sad pest to the agriculturist and a
great nuisance when they get inside the houses.
At Buenos Ayres they are very troublesome: I tried
myself every means in vain to get rid of them; their
ingenuity always baffled us; no contrivance could
keep anything in the shape of sweetmeats or dried
fruits or such things out of their clutches; and as to
the quantity of sugar they would carry off in a very
short time, it was incredible: we thought to escape
them by placing our stores upon tables, the legs
of which were surrounded by water, but they threw
straws and sticks into the water, and so made themselves
bridges to cross by. If we hung them from
the ceiling they climbed the walls and descended by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the ropes which suspended them. In our garden
they committed terrible depredations; and in the
summer-season it was always necessary to keep a
couple of men constantly employed for the sole purpose
of destroying their nests. We observed that
they could not exist in the sun; so that, if a basin
of sugar were half filled with them, as was constantly
the case, by putting it into the sun it was presently
cleared of every one of them.</p>

<p>The Jesuit father Guevara, in his account of Paraguay,
speaks of a species not noticed by Azara,
found about Villa Rica, which deposits upon certain
plants small globules of white wax, which the inhabitants
collect to make candles of. The utility they
are of in this respect, he says, in some measure compensates
for the damage they do to the husbandman.
Against their depredations, St. Simon and St. Jude,
and St. Bonifacio<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, have been by turns elected in due
form to be the special guardians and protectors of all
good Catholics.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, in those regions where these
insects most abound, an all-wise Providence has also
placed a most remarkable animal&mdash;formed, as it
would appear, expressly for the purpose of destroying
them and preventing their overrunning the
land&mdash;the tamandua, or, as we call it, the ant-bear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>
<p>I hardly know any animal which exhibits more
striking evidence of design on the part of the
Creator: slow and sluggish in all its movements,
without power of escape, and apparently without
the ordinary means of self-defence, its long trumpet-shaped
snout solely formed to contain the singular
prehensory organ with which it is furnished for the
purpose of taking its diminutive prey, being entirely
destitute of anything like the teeth of other animals;
it would be speedily exterminated by the beasts of
prey which abound where it is found, were it not&mdash;as
if to compensate for these deficiencies&mdash;providentially
supplied with strong sharp claws, and such
courage and muscular power to use them, as enables
it to defy every assailant. When attacked it throws
itself upon its back, and in that posture will make so
desperate a resistance, that it is a match either for
the jaguar or tiger, its fiercest enemies.</p>

<p>The ants are not the worst plagues in these countries:
destructive as they are, they are not to be
compared with the locusts; though, happily (and
indeed were it otherwise, all man's labour would be
vain), they are only occasional visitors. When they
do come they lay the land utterly desolate.</p>

<p>I once witnessed one of their visitations, and, but that
I had myself seen the extent of the devastation caused
by them, I certainly would not have believed it.</p>

<p>They made their appearance at first in a large
dense cloud, hovering high in the air, as if hesitating
where to descend. All the shovels and pots and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
pans in Buenos Ayres were put in requisition to
make a clatter to affright them, but in vain; down
they came, to the consternation of the owners of
every quinta, or garden, in the neighbourhood of the
city. They soon spread for several miles over the
surface of the land, and so thickly that it was like
driving over gravel to go amongst them;&mdash;that, I
well remember was just my impression upon going
out upon the high road in a carriage whilst they
were on the ground. They had then been at their
work of destruction two or three days, and were for
the most part so gorged as to be quite incapable of
moving; in a day or two more they had literally not
left a blade of grass or a green leaf to be seen; some
of those that were not then dying of satiety began
to devour one another. This was early in the year
1826. Though they were always as thick as grasshoppers,
I never saw at Buenos Ayres what was
termed a flight of locusts but that once, in nearly
nine years.</p>

<p>It was succeeded a few days afterwards by a flight
of small black beetles, which came down like hail,
and were swept up by shovels-full in our balconies:
it was a small insect, about the size of an earwig,
and was said to have the same habits; they worked
their way into the house in great numbers, where
they fell into a sort of torpid state, in which they
became an easy prey to the ants, who upon this
occasion were our active allies, and helped us to get
rid of them.</p>

<h3>THE OLD MISSIONS OF THE JESUITS.</h3>

<p>To the eastward of Corrientes are the depopulated
ruins, all that remain, of the once famed Missions
of the Jesuits, the greater part of which were situated
on the shores of the Paran&atilde; and Uruguay,
where the courses of those rivers nearly meet.</p>

<p>When the order was expelled from South America
in 1767, there were a hundred thousand inhabitants
in the thirty towns in those parts under
their control. In those situated east of the Paran&atilde;,
not a thousand souls remained in 1825, according to
an account I received from the officer who was in
command there at that period, and they were I believe
shortly afterwards swept off during the war
with Brazil for the occupation of the Banda Oriental.
The other towns beyond the Paran&atilde;, being within
the jurisdiction of Paraguay, have fared little better
under Dr. Francia.</p>

<p>This was that <i>Imperium in imperio</i> which once
excited the astonishment of the world and the jealousy
of princes: how little cause they had to be
alarmed by it was best proved by the whole fabric
falling to pieces on the removal of a few poor old
priests: a more inoffensive community never existed.</p>

<p>It was an experiment on a vast scale, originated in
the purest spirit of Christianity, to domesticate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
render useful hordes of savages who would otherwise,
like the rest of the aborigines, have been miserably
exterminated in war or slavery by the conquerors of
the land. Its remarkable success excited envy and
jealousy, and caused a thousand idle tales to be circulated
as to the political views of the Jesuits in
founding such establishments, which unfortunately
gained too easy credence in a credulous age, and contributed,
there is no doubt, to hasten the downfall of
their order.</p>

<p>Their real crime, if crime it was, was the possession
of that moral power and influence which was
the natural consequence of their surpassing knowledge
and wisdom in the times in which they lived.</p>

<p>With respect to their Missions in South America,
nothing could be more inconsistent than the allegations
made against them:&mdash;whilst accused, on the
one hand, of aiming at the establishment of a powerful
and independent supremacy, they were, on the
other, at the same time, reproached with having systematically
kept the Indians in a state of infantine
tutelage.</p>

<p>What would have been the consequences of the
opposite system? How long would the Spanish
rule in those countries have lasted had the Jesuits
trained up a hundred thousand of the proper owners
of the soil in any practical knowledge of the rights
of man? How long would the Jesuits themselves
have preserved their influence with them?</p>

<p>The Indians loved the Jesuits, and looked to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
as to their fathers, and great were their lamentations
when they were taken from them, and replaced by
the unprincipled Franciscan friars sent to them by
Bucareli, the Captain General of Buenos Ayres:&mdash;the
following memorials, addressed to him from the
Missions of San Luis and Martires, will serve to
throw some light on the true feelings of the people
with regard to their old and new pastors.</p>

<p>I have given a copy of one of the originals in
Guarani in the Appendix, as a specimen of a language,
which, of all the native tongues, was, perhaps,
the most diffused in South America, and which, to
this day, may be traced from the Paran&atilde; to the
Amazons:&mdash;</p>


<h4>No. I.</h4>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Translation of a Memorial addressed by the people
of the Mission of San Luis to the Governor of
Buenos Ayres, praying that the Jesuits may remain
with them instead of the Friars sent to replace
them.</i></p></div>

<p class="center">(J. H. S.)</p>

<p>"God preserve your Excellency, say we, the
Cabildo, and all the Caciques and Indians, men,
women, and children, of San Luis, as your Excellency
is our father. The Corregidor Santiago
Pindo and Don Pantaleon Cayuari, in their love
for us, have written to us for certain birds which
they desire we will send them for the King:&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
are very sorry not to have them to send, inasmuch as
they live where God made them&mdash;in the forests,&mdash;and
fly far away from us, so that we cannot catch
them.</p>

<p>"Withal we are the vassals of God and of the
King, and always desirous to fulfil the wishes of his
ministers in what they desire of us. Have we not
been three times as far as Colonia with our aid!&mdash;and
do we not labour in order to pay tribute!&mdash;and
now we pray to God that that best of birds&mdash;the
Holy Ghost&mdash;may descend upon the King, and enlighten
him, and may the Holy Angel preserve him!</p>

<p>"So, confiding in your Excellency, Se&ntilde;or Governor,
our proper father, with all humility, and
with tears, we beg that the Sons of St. Ignatius, the
Fathers of the Society of Jesus, may continue to live
with us and remain always amongst us. This we
beg your Excellency to supplicate of the King for
us for the love of God:&mdash;all this people,&mdash;men,
women, and young persons, and especially the poor,&mdash;pray
for the same with tears in their eyes.</p>

<p>"As for the friars and priests sent to replace
them, we love them not. The Apostle St. Thomas,
the minister of God, so taught our forefathers in
these same parts,&mdash;for these friars and priests have
no care for us. The Sons of San Ignatius, yes,&mdash;they,
from the very first, took care of our forefathers,
and taught them, and baptized them, and preserved
them for God and the King:&mdash;but for these friars
and priests, in no manner do we wish for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Fathers of the Society of Jesus know how
to bear with our weaknesses, and we were happy
under them for God's sake and the King's:&mdash;if
your Excellency, good Se&ntilde;or Governor, will listen
to our prayer, and grant our request, we will pay
larger tribute in the <i>yerba caa-mini</i>.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>"We are not slaves, and we desire to say that
the Spanish custom is not to our liking,&mdash;for every
one to take care of himself, instead of assisting
one another in their daily labours.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This is the
plain truth which we say to your Excellency, that
it may be attended to:&mdash;if it is not, this people, like
the rest, will be lost. This to your Excellency, to
the King, and to God,&mdash;we shall go to the Devil!&mdash;and
at the hour of our death where will be our help?</p>

<p>"Our children, who are in the country and in the
towns, when they return and find not the Sons of
San Ignatius, will flee away to the deserts and to
the forests to do evil. Already it would seem that
the people of San Joaquim, San Estanislaus, San
Ferdinand, and Tymbo, are lost,&mdash;we know it well,
and we say so to your Excellency:&mdash;neither can the
Cabildos ever restore these people for God and the
King as they were.</p>

<p>"So, good Governor, grant us what we ask,&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>may God help and keep you. This is what we say
in the name of the people of San Luis, this 28th of
February, 1768.</p>

<p><i>Complaint of the people of Martires of the conduct
of the priests sent to them after the expulsion of
the Jesuits.</i></p></div>

<p class="center">(J. H. S.)</p>

<p>
"To our most excellent Governor:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>"Blessed and praised be the holy sacrament!
God our Lord grant you a long life and health on
earth, and happiness hereafter in heaven. So we
pray him,&mdash;we, the Corregidor, Cabildo, and Caciques
of the people of the Holy Martyrs,&mdash;who,
casting ourselves with all humility at your feet, give
praises to God and to our King, and to you, Se&ntilde;or
Governor, for having come by his command, as his
deputy, amongst us.</p>

<p>"Holding you in the highest reverence, we make
known to you that all this people are perfectly
obedient to the orders of our Catholic King, trying
to esteem and respect the spiritual pastors sent to
us, in nothing failing in our duties towards them,
with all due respect, as they are the ministers of God.</p>

<p>"But, although this is our behaviour, they are
not satisfied with us:&mdash;for two or three days they
were pleased with our humility, and no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has happened that the Corregidor, wishing
to execute the orders of the Governor, the Curate
has said,&mdash;'This man wrongs you:&mdash;in what light
do you look upon his authority compared with that
of your priests? The King himself is only a superior
governor, and shall be food for the worms, and
nothing more:&mdash;I fear no one.' Saying so he ordered
fifty stripes to be given to an Indian; and a
poor woman he ordered to be tied to a post, and
flogged. He goes about with a stick in his hand
to beat us, and a few days past he punished an
Indian with blows in the church itself, before all the
people:&mdash;another he beat in the square, saying,&mdash;'If
I kill him I shall do no great harm.'</p>

<p>"The Administrator alone sometimes protects us
from these punishments, saying to him, with proper
respect,&mdash;'Father, you have no business to interfere
in temporal matters,'&mdash;and for this he is not well
with him. This officer endeavours to observe the
commands of God and of the King for the good of
this people, and in nothing have we to complain of
him. He helps us on all occasions, and much we
stand in need of it, Se&ntilde;or Governor.</p>

<p>"But God and the King have appointed you for
our comfort, and so we make known to you our
difficulties. We are fearful lest the people should
lose their obedience and respect for the King's
orders, when they hear the priests call the mandates
of the King, and of his Governor, words of no consequence:&mdash;and
so for your guidance we tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the truth, which God knows, and is testified to by
all this people. Santos Martires, 16th April, 1768."</p>

<p class="right">(Signed by the Cabildo, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>Bucareli, on receipt of the first of these simple
documents, sent it to Spain, with the ridiculous
announcement that he considered it as the forerunner
of a rising in favour of the Jesuits, and had,
in consequence, ordered a chosen body of troops
to proceed immediately from Paraguay and Corrientes
to the neighbourhood of the Missions to be
in readiness to put down the expected insurrection:
thither too he proceeded himself to take the field
in person against the rebels.</p>

<p>He found them not in arms but in tears:&mdash;the
Jesuits, though he could not believe it, had brought
up the Indians in obedience, and in the love of their
King as well as of God,&mdash;and, having said their say,
they resigned themselves submissively to the orders
of their newly-appointed superiors,&mdash;giving thanks
to the King for having sent a personage of such
importance as Bucareli to take care of them.
Bucareli met, in fact, with not the slightest opposition
from the Indians, in substituting his own
system of administration for that of the Jesuits,
which he had been amongst the foremost to find
fault with.</p>

<p>The efficacy of his own measures may be judged
by their result:&mdash;he sent them civil governors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
appointed Franciscan friars for their spiritual pastors:&mdash;the
misrule of the first, and the little respect
inspired by the latter, compared with the uniformly
exemplary lives of their predecessors, brought about
in little more than a quarter of a century, the entire
ruin and depopulation of these once happy and prosperous
communities. The Indians, as they themselves
predicted in their letter to him, when there
was no longer sufficient wisdom in their governors
to prevent it, were lost both to God and the King.</p>

<p>In saying this I do not pretend to dispute that
the institutions of the Jesuits were not, in many
points, defective, like all others of man's creation;
they were, however, framed under very remarkable
and novel circumstances, for which great allowances
must be made in any comparison of them
with the social systems of Europe; if we look at
the good they did, rather than for the evil which
they did not, we shall find that, in the course of
about a century and a half, upwards of a million of
Indians were made Christians by them, and taught
to be happy and contented under the mild and
peaceful rule of their enlightened and admirable
pastors,&mdash;a blessed lot compared with the savage
condition of the unreclaimed tribes around them.</p>

<h3>PARAGUAY,</h3>

<p>strictly speaking, has no place in this book, being,
as it is for the present, a distinct and separate Republic;
but, like the Missions, it is impossible to
pass so near it without some allusion to its former
prosperity, and to its present very singular condition
under the despotic rule of Dr. Francia.</p>

<p>It was in Paraguay that the first conquerors of
the country fixed their abode and the seat of their
government:&mdash;it was there also, attracted by the
same inducements of a genial clime and a profusion
of natural productions to satisfy all man's wants,
that the Jesuit fathers laid the original foundations
of their celebrated establishments just spoken of.
Its population, before it ceased to be a province
subject to the government of Buenos Ayres, was
estimated at 200,000 souls, and the yearly value of
its surplus produce, exported for consumption to
Buenos Ayres and the interior provinces, fell little
short of a million and a half of dollars. Eight
millions of pounds of Paraguay tea were annually
sent to Santa F&eacute; and Buenos Ayres, besides a
million of pounds of tobacco, large quantities of
timber for every purpose, cotton, sugar, molasses,
spirits, and a variety of other articles.</p>

<p>The yerba-mat&eacute;, or tea, which forms the principal
article in the list, is as much in general use and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
demand throughout all the provinces of La Plata,
Chile, and many parts of Peru, as the teas of China
are in Europe. The plant which produces it (the
<i>Ilex Paraguayensis</i>) is an evergreen about the size
of an orange-tree, which grows wild and in great
abundance in the dense forests in the northern and
eastern parts of the province, whither the people
repair yearly in numerous gangs to collect it. The
difficulties of penetrating the woods to reach the
yerbales, as they are called, are considerable, but
they are amply repaid by the certain profits of the
adventure. The whole process of preparing and
packing it for market is performed on the spot.
The tender branches and twigs, being selected, are
roasted quickly over a fire till the leaves are crisp;
and then, after being partially crushed or pounded,
are rammed into hide bags, called serrons, containing
200 lbs. each, which, when sown up, are ready for
sale.</p>

<p>The Jesuits cultivated the plant, of which there
are three species, in their Missions; and by attention
produced a better quality of tea, called <i>caa-mini</i>,
than that from the wild plant collected in the
woods.</p>

<p>From the practice of reducing the leaf nearly to
dust probably originated the general custom in South
America of sucking the infusion when made through
a tube, at one end of which is a strainer, which prevents
the small particles of the tea-leaves from getting
into the mouth: it is usually made very strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
very hot, and very sweet with sugar; its properties
seem to be much the same as those of the China tea.
The Spaniards learned to use it from the Guarani
Indians.</p>

<p>When the Viceroy's power was overthrown in
1810, the province of Paraguay refused to acknowledge
the central government set up at Buenos Ayres
to succeed him, and an army was in consequence sent
to reduce it to obedience; but the Paraguay troops
defeated the Buenos Ayrean general, Belgrano, who
was glad to capitulate, and be permitted to return
whence he came. Emboldened by this success,
which gave them an idea of their own consequence
beyond any they had before entertained, they proceeded
at once to assert their absolute independence,
not only of Buenos Ayres, but of the mother country,
and to declare Paraguay a free and sovereign state,
a step beyond any at that time contemplated, perhaps
even by the rulers of Buenos Ayres themselves,
who, though self-elected, continued to act in the
King's name up to 1816, the date of their declaration
of independence at Tucuman.</p>

<p>This proclamation of the independence of Paraguay
was followed in the first instance by the setting
up of a triumvirate government, of which Francia
was the secretary, and soon became the secret mover
of the whole machine. A sort of Mephistopheles, he
was not long ere he set the members of the government
by the ears, and by his intrigues brought about
their resignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the convocation of a general assembly
of deputies from all the towns and villages of the
province, to consider what was to be done under
the circumstances. By these poor ignorant people
thus dragged from their homes, Francia, a person
in authority, a lawyer, or learned man,&mdash;for the
terms are synonymous in the language of Paraguay,&mdash;living
like an ascetic, and affecting a sort of
cabalistical knowledge, was looked upon with a kind
of reverential awe, as a person of wonderful acquirements
and sagacity, whose opinions were eagerly
sought to guide them in the weighty matters they
were called upon to discuss, whilst on his own part
he was not behindhand in maturing his plans and
securing his influence.</p>

<p>When the Congress met he laid before it the following
project for a government, which, as he anticipated,
was regarded as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
wisdom, and was adopted by acclamation (<i>por acclamacion</i>).
I give the document entire, not only because
it has never before appeared in English, but
as the best evidence of the low cunning of the projector,
and of the extreme simplicity and subserviency
of those who adopted it, believing all the
time that they were a free and independent people.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>Plan for a Constitution proposed by Dr. Francia to
the General Congress of Paraguay, and adopted
by acclamation.</i></p></div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Article I.</span>&mdash;The two citizens Don Fulencio
Yegros and Don Jos&eacute; Gaspar de Francia shall alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
constitute the government, with the title of 'Consuls
of the Republic of Paraguay.' They shall have the
rank and honours of Brigadier-Generals, and their
commissions as such shall be signed by the President
of this Congress.</p>

<p>"Art. II.&mdash;They shall wear, as the insignia of
their Consular dignity, a hat bound with blue, and
the tri-coloured scarf of the Republic. They shall
have the like and equal jurisdiction and authority,
which they shall exercise uniformly and conjointly.
In consequence, all acts of the Government shall be
signed by both.</p>

<p>"Art. III.&mdash;Their first duty shall be the preservation,
security, and defence of the Republic,
with all the vigilance, judgment, and activity required
under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>"Art. IV.&mdash;There shall henceforward be no Presidency.</p>

<p>"Art. V.&mdash;All the forces of the Province shall
be under the joint command in chief of the two
Consuls.</p>

<p>"Art. VI.&mdash;Nevertheless, all the active and effective
troops of every grade, as well as all the arms and
ammunition, shall be equally divided, and placed at
the disposal, half and half, of each Consul, and each
shall have his own separate barracks and magazines
under his own command.</p>

<p>"Art. VII.&mdash;There shall be two battalions of
infantry, each to consist of three or four companies
for the present, or of more if necessary; so that each
Consul shall have his separate battalion, of which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
shall be the chief and commandant exclusively: he
shall also have the command of one of the two companies
of artillery; Consul Yegros shall command
the first, and Consul Francia the second; the latter
shall form his own battalion, towards which he shall
be at liberty to take the fifth part of that commanded
by Consul Yegros.</p>

<p>"Art. VIII.&mdash;The officers and men of these corps
shall be approved of by their respective Chiefs, the
said Consuls; but all officers' commissions shall be
signed by both jointly, though they may be proposed
by their own commanders respectively: in like manner,
if it should be necessary to try them for any
offence, it shall be before the two Consuls jointly.</p>

<p>"Art. IX.&mdash;The Consuls shall preside over the
tribunals in turn for four months at a time each,
with the title of 'Consul in Turn,' and not 'Consul
Presiding,' lest that designation should give rise to
mistakes. Consul Francia shall take the first turn,
and in all cases, when the turn comes round, a notice
of it, signed by both, shall be inserted in a book, and
sent to the Cabildo of the city for their information.</p>

<p>"Art. X.&mdash;A chamber shall be set apart in the
Government House for the Tribunal of the Consuls:
it shall be open during the hours of office, and its
forms shall be regulated by the Consul in Turn for
the time being.</p>

<p>"Art. XI.&mdash;The Secretary shall take cognisance
of such cases on which doubts may arise, and which
are not hereby provided for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Art. XII.&mdash;It is left to the will and prudence
of the two Consuls to regulate by common accord all
that may be requisite for the due despatch of the
business of the State, in all its branches; as well as
to appoint one or, if necessary, two secretaries; also
to create a superior tribunal of appeal, to determine,
according to law, as a Court of Last Resort, such
cases as it may be necessary to refer to it.</p>

<p>"Art XIII.&mdash;If either of the two Consuls should
die or resign, the other shall proceed within a month
to call together the General Congress of the Province,
which shall consist of <i>one thousand Deputies</i>,
chosen, like the present, by popular election; and it
shall be a fundamental, general, perpetual, and invariable
law and rule, that henceforward such General
Congress of the Province shall assemble every
year, convoked in the same manner, and to consist
of the aforesaid number of one thousand representatives;
and the day for their meeting shall always
be on the 15th of October: and the necessary convocation
and summonses shall be issued in consequence
by the middle of every month of September,
in order that the Province may duly, and at least
once a year, meet as a free and sovereign people, to
deliberate on what may be most conducive to the
general good, to improve, if necessary, its government,
to provide remedies for abuses, and to take all
such measures as may be suggested by the wisdom
of experience.</p>

<p>"Art. XIV.&mdash;These rules shall be observed until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
altered by any future Congress, and shall be copied
into the Book of the Resolutions of Government.</p>

<p>"Art. XV.&mdash;The Consuls shall immediately appear
before the present Sovereign Congress to swear
to observe faithfully, and to cause to be observed,
these rules and regulations. The same oath shall
be also forthwith administered by their order to all
the officers of the troops, and by the officers to the
soldiers, whereof a proper record shall be inserted
in the archives of the Congress; and whoever shall
refuse to take the said oath shall be dismissed the
service, and punished as though he had broken it.</p>

<p>"Art. XVI.&mdash;The Province adopts the forms, as
well as the number of Representatives assembled in
the actual Congress, and the Government shall make
no change in either one or the other.</p>

<p class="right">"<i>Done and Signed at Assumption,</i><br />
<i>the 12th October, 1813.</i>"
</p>

<p>Francia, having thus obtained one-half the power
he aimed at, was not long ere he secured the other.
When the thousand deputies met, in virtue of the
13th article of the Constitution, it was intimated to
them that the substitution of one Governor for a pair
of Consuls would be a great improvement; and
Don Gaspar was, as a matter of course, elected sole
Dictator, of the Republic of Paraguay.</p>

<p>His nomination in the first instance was for three
years; at the expiration of which time he took care
to have his power confirmed for life. The Deputies
who passed this act, in their simplicity, returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
their homes exulting in an arrangement whereby
they were saved all further trouble, whilst the tyrant
they had set up commenced a reign which, for systematic
selfishness, cruelty, and unrestrained despotism,
is almost unparalleled in the history of any
country.</p>

<p>His first object, as may be supposed, was to put
down all opposition; and this he did by imprisoning,
banishing, or putting to death every individual of
wealth or influence who could in any way interfere
with him in the exercise of his despotic sway:&mdash;his
spies were in every house, the most trivial expression
of dissatisfaction was construed into treason, and ere
long no man dared to speak to his neighbour for
fear of being denounced: thus he silenced by
terror all opposition from within; and, lest any
should be attempted from without, he proceeded to
restrict the communication with the adjoining provinces,
and at last to establish a system of non-intercourse
which for nearly twenty years he has
rigorously enforced, and will doubtless continue to
do so as long as he lives. The only trade, if trade
it can be called, which of late years has been carried
on, has been upon his own account, and such as has
been necessary to further his own policy of habituating
the lower classes to look to him, and to him only, for
the supply of all their wants. His mode of managing
this business is as singular as all the rest of his proceedings.
When he wants an assortment of foreign
goods, a permit is sent over to the adjoining province
of Corrientes for a vessel to proceed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
opposite port of Nembuc&uacute;; on her arrival there,
the invoice of the cargo is immediately forwarded
to him at Assumption, from which, after selecting
such articles as he requires, he orders a quantity of
yerba-mat&eacute; to be put on board in payment. There
is no appeal from his own valuation: no one is
allowed to go on shore, and the ship is sent back as
soon as the yerba is delivered:&mdash;the article itself is
in such demand, from his having stopped the trade
in it, that the people of Corrientes are glad to get it
upon his own terms. He is the owner of several
shops or stores, in Assumption, from which the
goods are afterwards retailed, by his permission, to
those who may stand in need of them.</p>

<p>In the same manner for a short period he allowed
a peddling traffic to be carried on between the Brazilian
Missions beyond the river Uruguay and the
port of Ytapua, opposite to Candelaria, but that he
altogether stopped about ten years ago.</p>

<p>His revenue chiefly arises from properties confiscated
by his own arbitrary judgments, and from
tithes in kind upon all articles of produce, the
right to levy which is yearly sold by the government
to the best bidder in each department; the
contractors generally underlet them to others, and
they are in consequence rigorously exacted.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The
principal expenditure is in the maintenance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
large militia force, in which every person capable of
bearing arms is enrolled and called upon to do duty
in turn. Francia is of course commander-in-chief
of the army, as he is the head of the church, the
law, and every other branch of the administration.</p>

<p>When I arrived in the River Plate, in 1824, I
found that many British subjects had been for several
years detained in Paraguay by this monster against
their will; and it became my duty in consequence to
make a representation to him upon the subject, and
to apply for their liberation. This I was fortunate
enough to obtain, together with the release of many
other Europeans, whom, that it should not appear
that he was granting any special favour to the
English, he allowed at the same time to depart;
amongst the rest Messrs. Rengger and Longchamps,
two Swiss gentlemen, who have since published a
highly-interesting account of their detention, and of
the state of the country.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>He made, however, an exception of M. Bompland,
the well-known companion of Baron Humboldt,
whom he had some years before caused to be seized
and carried off by an armed force, sent across the
Paran&atilde; for the purpose, whilst engaged in his own
inoffensive pursuits in the province of Corrientes.
As there was no accredited French agent at Buenos
Ayres at the time, I took upon myself to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
another application to Francia, specially in favour of
an individual in whose fate I could justly say that
all the scientific world was interested; and I further
offered to guarantee the fulfilment of any promise
M. Bompland might himself choose to make, in case
of his liberation, to return at once to Europe. I
wrote in the same sense to M. Bompland, and enclosed
my letter, open, to the Dictator, to forward to
its destination if he approved of it. But, instead of
doing so, he returned it to me, with a rude intimation
that that must close our correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>I believe he was disappointed at finding that I
could not concur with him in his notion of opening
a direct trade between Great Britain and Paraguay,
on which it appeared he had long set his heart, the
rather as he expected thereby to be able to show to
his own subjects his independence of his neighbours,
and especially of the Buenos Ayreans.</p>

<p>That so extraordinary a state of things should so
long have existed is I believe entirely to be ascribed
to the miserable weakness of the adjoining provinces,
which, had they been able to make the slightest
combined effort, might long ago have put an end to
the tyrannical rule of this crazy old despot. Nature
will probably do this ere long, when it may be expected
that Paraguay will once more join the confederation
of her sister provinces.</p>

<p>In proceeding now to give such information as I
have been able to collect respecting the state of the
provinces on the road to Peru, and to the westward
of it, I shall take them in their geographical order,
although it may be as well to observe that they
were not, as may be supposed, originally conquered
and settled by the discoverers of the Rio de la Plata.
Those adventurers, following the course of the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Paraguay, reduced to subjection the warlike tribes
they found upon its shores, and, navigating its higher
branches, after incredible hardships and many valiant
deeds, succeeded in opening a communication
with their countrymen in Peru; but they made no
attempt to possess themselves of the vast extent of
country lying to the westward of them.</p>

<p>The discovery of those regions was reserved for
the followers of Almagro, who, after the conquest
of Peru, marched southward to take possession of
Chile, in fulfilment of his agreement with Pizarro;
and his successors laid claim to them as part of the
jurisdiction originally allotted to him in virtue of
that agreement&mdash;a pretension which gave rise to
many contentions amongst the chiefs who first established
themselves in those parts; nor were they
put an end to until, by the king's authority, these
settlements, comprising Tucuman, Santiago del Estero,
the towns in the valley of Catamarca, and
many others since destroyed, were erected into a
distinct and separate province called Tucuman, from
the chief of the Calchaqui tribes which inhabited
them. This was in 1563, some years before the
existence of Buenos Ayres. Nor was it indeed till
nearly half a century after De Garay had founded
his settlement there that they became politically
connected, and were united under one and the same
government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>


<h3>PROVINCE OF CORDOVA.</h3>

<p>The province of Cordova, after that of Buenos
Ayres, is the most important of the Union. According
to a census taken in 1822-23, the population
then amounted to something more than 85,000
souls, of which from 12,000 to 14,000 lived in the
city.</p>

<p>It is ruled by a governor, who is elective by a
provincial junta occasionally convoked, and whose
power is almost arbitrary; he has the command of
all the forces and militia of the province, and has
the power of reversing, on appeal, all decisions of
the tribunals.</p>

<p>It is bounded by the province of Santiago del
Estero to the north, and Santa F&eacute; to the east, and
on the western side by the mountain-ranges generally
known as the Sierra de Cordova. From these
ranges descend many rivers and streams which irrigate
and fertilise the plains below; amongst which
may be enumerated the Rio San Miguel, the Tortoral,
the Carnero, the Primero, Segundo, Tercero,
Quarto, and Quinto: of these the Tercero is the only
one which reaches the Paran&atilde;; all the rest are lost
in the flat intervening plains. It has been ascertained
that very little is requisite to render the Tercero
navigable for boats from the Paran&atilde; to within
about thirty leagues of the city, whereby a water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
communication might be opened, which would save
much of the present expensive and tedious land carriage
of the productions not only of Cordova, but of
the provinces of Cuyo, to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The perpetual irrigation of so many streams gives
rise to a constant supply of excellent pasturage for
cattle and sheep, the facility of rearing which may
in some measure account for the preference evinced
by the people for pastoral over agricultural pursuits.
These habits occasion the country population
to be much scattered: they congregate but little in
the towns; and the principal places after the capital,
Conception, Ranchos, and Carlotta, are at the
best but wretched villages.</p>

<p>In travelling from Buenos Ayres after passing the
post of Frayle Muerto on the river Tercero, the
aspect of the country begins to change: it becomes
undulated, and at last there is an end of the monotonous
scenery of the Pampas, throughout which
not a tree is to be seen save the solitary Umb&uacute;, standing
like a giant land-mark in the boundless plain.</p>

<p>The traveler's eye is relieved by the appearance
of woods and forests which become more dense as
the Sierra is approached. The trees are for the
most part varieties of the mimosa family, thickly
set with thorns; and so marked is this peculiarity
in those parts, that I recollect a gentleman from
Cordova who came to Buenos Ayres whilst I was
there, expressing something more than common sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>prise
at finding that the greater part of the trees
which grew in the gardens about the city, and which
were probably chiefly of European origin, were not
covered with thorns like those of his own province.</p>

<p>The palm-tree is scattered over the valleys in the
northern part of the province, and on the road to
Santiago del Estero; and it is the land of the aloe
and cactus in every variety.</p>

<p>The city which gives its name to the province was
founded by the conquerors of Tucuman in 1573;
it is situated in lat. 31&deg; 26&acute; 14",<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> long. from Ferro,
314&deg; 36&acute; 45", in a pleasant valley upon the banks of
the river Primero, sheltered from the north and
south winds, which, in the more exposed parts of
the province blowing alternately hot and cold, produce
great and sudden variations in the atmosphere,
very trying to the constitutions of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>By the post-road it is 172 leagues distant from
Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>It is related that for many years after its foundation,
the inhabitants were subjected to much inconvenience
from the occasional overflowings of a lake
in the neighbouring hills, until an earthquake swallowed
up its waters, and drained it apparently for
ever. Much damage, however, is still done by the
mountain-torrents which descend from the Sierra in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the rainy season, and have made it necessary to build
strong walls to save the city from being occasionally
inundated.</p>

<p>Limestone and timber being to be had in the immediate
neighbourhood, the houses are generally
better built than in other towns in the interior.</p>

<p>Cordova contains many churches, and is the seat
of a university, at which, in the time of the Old
Spaniards, most of the better classes from all parts
of the Vice-Royalty received their education: it was
under the management of the Jesuits, to whom this
city owes much of its importance. It was here they
had their principal college (the Colegio Maximo);
and they held large possessions in the neighbourhood,
from whence they derived considerable revenues,
the greater part of which were spent in the foundation
and embellishment of the churches, and in other
pious establishments. Here also they had a celebrated
library, rich in manuscript records of their
Missions and labours amongst the Indians, which
upon their expulsion was sent to Buenos Ayres.
The printed books formed the nucleus of the present
public library in that city; but the greater part of
the manuscripts, and amongst the rest an unpublished
portion of Father Guevara's History, have
never since been seen: they were probably, either
sent to Spain or destroyed by Bucareli, who was
charged with the expulsion of the Order; a duty
which he fulfilled with a harshness and illiberality
never to be forgotten in a country which owes all it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
possesses in the shape of civilization, to the indefatigable
zeal and enlightened spirit of that community.</p>

<p>Out of their confiscated property the university
of Buenos Ayres was subsequently founded; and
being more conveniently situated for the rising generation,
it has in proportion diminished the importance
of that of Cordova, which, though still kept up,
has dwindled to the scale of a provincial school.</p>

<p>From the year 1699 Cordova was also the residence
of a bishop (removed from Tucuman), but the
see has been vacant since the first years of the revolution.</p>

<p>The effects of the preponderating influence of the
monastic establishments are still visible in the habits
of the generality of the people; and though the
ladies are not all nuns, their manners are a vast deal
more reserved than those either of the capital or of
the other principal provincial towns. As an instance
of this, a fair lady of Buenos Ayres told me
she had caused no little scandal whist on a visit to
some of her Cordova relations, by insisting on dancing
at a ball with a male partner, instead of with
one of her own sex, an innovation which greatly
horrified the mamas. Captain Andrews, too, has
given a lively account of the alarm he unwittingly
occasioned by a like breach of decorum in offering
his arm to a young lady on going to dinner. These
scruples, however, have I believe, since been much
modified, and I am told that ladies and gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
now dance country-dances together at Cordova,
much as they do in other parts of the world, in spite
of the fears of the mamas and the frowns of the
priests.</p>

<p>Living is very cheap and provisions abundant,
the wants of the people few, and their hospitality
unbounded; their kindness, indeed, to strangers, is
spoken of by all who have been amongst them.</p>

<p>Cordova at present forms a sort of centre of communication
between the Upper Provinces and Buenos
Ayres. Its own produce, consisting chiefly of hides
and wool, is all sent to the capital, whence it receives
European manufactured goods in exchange.</p>

<p>If steam navigation were established on the Paran&atilde;
between Buenos Ayres and Santa F&eacute;, Cordova, as
well as the provinces further north, would share in
its advantages, and would be more easily supplied
through Santa F&eacute;, by the road which runs nearly in
a direct line between the two cities; whilst the
shorter line of communication thus opened between
the provinces of Cuyo and those on the Paran&atilde;,
passing necessarily through Cordova, would fully
compensate to the people of that place for any
loss they might sustain in consequence of the transit
trade from Buenos Ayres to the Upper Provinces
being turned in another direction.</p>

<p>The people of Cordova and Santa F&eacute; would also
once more have a joint interest in checking the inroads
of the Indians from the Chaco, and by a better
combination of their joint means might be enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
to protect their frontiers more effectually and perhaps
at less expense than either province is now at
for the maintenance of the militia which is requisite
for its separate defence.</p>

<p>Cordova, owing to the miserable weakness of the
adjoining governments of both Santa F&eacute; and San
Luis, is obliged at present to support a large armed
force to protect her frontiers, not only from the
savages of the Chaco, but from those of the Pampas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>


<h3>PROVINCE OF LA RIOJA.</h3>

<p>To the west of the province of Cordova, across the
Sierra, lies La Rioja, formerly a dependency of that
government, but now dignified with the title of an
independent province, divided into four departments,
viz., Arauco, Guandacol, the Lla&ntilde;os, and
Famatina. It is nominally under the rule of a
governor and a municipal junta of five members.
The city from which it takes its name was founded
in 1591, at the foot of the Sierra de Velasco, a granitic
range, and is situated, according to a MS. in
my possession, in latitude 29&deg; 12&acute;, though I know
not upon whose authority. In 1824 the population
did not amount to more than 3500 souls, though the
whole province may contain from 18,000 to 20,000.
Arauco, which is the most northern department,
contains about 3000, chiefly occupied in the cultivation
of vineyards, from which they make 8000 or
10,000 small barrels annually, of a strong sweet
wine, which is sent to Cordova and the neighbouring
provinces.</p>

<p>Guandacol, which lies to the westward, beyond
the range of Famatina, and along the base of the
Cordillera of Chile, contains about 1500 inhabitants,&mdash;chiefly
congregated in the towns of Guandacol
and Vinchina. They are employed in agriculture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and, at a particular season, in hunting the vicu&ntilde;as
in the Cordillera, the wool of which forms a valuable
article of trade:&mdash;the flesh is an article of food.</p>

<p>The Lla&ntilde;os, which lie to the south of La Rioja,
constitute a rich grazing district, in which about
20,000 head of cattle are annually bred. The inhabitants
are calculated to be about 6000.</p>

<p>The department of Famatina, of which Chilecito
is the principal place, lies to the west of La Rioja;
it contains 5000 or 6000 inhabitants, who, like those
of Arauco, are much engaged in the cultivation of
their vineyards, from which they make 6000 or 8000
barrels of wine yearly. It takes its name from the
famous mineral range of Famatina, distant from La
Rioja about thirty leagues:&mdash;this range is described
to extend for fifty leagues; in the centre is the
Nevado, a lofty peak covered with perpetual snow,&mdash;its
geological formation is chiefly gneiss and clay-slate;
but it is specially celebrated for the richness
of its silver ores, which are said to surpass in intrinsic
value those of Potosi,&mdash;the extreme remoteness
and inclemency of their situation, however,
accessible only by rugged and difficult mountain
paths, has been a constant bar to their being worked
to any extent, and as yet they may be said to be
only superficially known: nevertheless a mint was
established at La Rioja, at which some gold and
silver coins have been struck; and, in 1824 and
1825, during the rage for mining speculations in
South America, companies were formed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
working of those of Famatina:&mdash;those schemes, however,
only ended in disappointment to all concerned
in them, not from any scarcity, I believe, of the
precious metals, but from miscalculations and mismanagement,
and an entire ignorance of the political
state of the country. In such remote parts it has
been but too sadly proved how little foreigners
can calculate upon any effectual protection either
for their property or their persons. It is idle to
talk of contracts or title-deeds where the only real
law is the will of some petty despot, whose necessities
or interests, direct or indirect, will always
overrule all other considerations. That such should
be the state of La Rioja is not surprising, when
its geographical position is considered, which cuts
it off from almost all intercourse with the more
civilised parts of the republic. The roads which
lead to it, if roads they can be called, which are
hardly passable by mules, are as bad as they can be,
whilst the distances by these circuitous paths to the
nearest of the other provincial towns are enormous.
From La Rioja to Cordova it is 114 leagues, to
Mendoza 159, and to Buenos Ayres by the nearest
beaten route 287. To Guasco or Copiapo, the
nearest towns in Chile, the length of the route by
the Cordillera of Guandacol is 130 leagues:&mdash;this
pass is said to be easy of transit, and has been often
used to convey goods across the Cordillera from
Chile, when the communication with Buenos Ayres has
been closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>The people, as might be expected, are in a lamentable
state of ignorance. The governor himself,
in sending me an account of his province, confessed
that the only school in it was one established in the
town of La Rioja, where the instruction was entirely
limited to reading and writing, and that, for
want of support, was often closed.</p>

<p>If the establishment of the present federal system
be found of any real advantage, or gratifying to the
ambition of some other provinces, the local situation
and means of which may induce them to
look forward with any confidence to improving their
social condition; on the other hand I fear it must be
fatal to those which, like La Rioja, are necessarily
thrown by it upon resources which are palpably
inadequate either to ensure them any tolerably efficient
government for the present, or any likelihood
of an improvement in their condition hereafter. It
seems to me that the only means of saving them
from lapsing into a state of semi-barbarism is to
make them, as before, dependencies of their more
powerful neighbours:&mdash;nor would they alone benefit
by such an arrangement; a concentration of the
Republic into half-a-dozen instead of twice the number
of provincial governments (as was originally
contemplated when it was divided into provinces
in 1813 and 1814), would render each in itself
infinitely more respectable, and better able to maintain
its own independence, whilst it would vastly
facilitate the management of all their national in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>terests
and affairs by the government of Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p>The provinces to the north of Cordova and La
Rioja originally formed only two governments, according
to the division established by the National
Congress in 1814:&mdash;that of Tucuman, which included
Santiago del Estero and Catamarca; and
that of Salta with Jujuy, Oran, and Tarija; but
these have since subdivided themselves, and instead
of two now form five distinct governments,&mdash;viz.,
Santiago, Tucuman, Catamarca, Salta, and Tarija,&mdash;the
latter of which has become united to Bolivia:
of the others, the first, after leaving Cordova, is
Santiago del Estero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>


<h3>SANTIAGO DEL ESTERO.</h3>

<p>The distance from the city of Cordova to that of
Santiago del Estero is 110 leagues by the post-road.
Portezuela is the first station beyond the jurisdiction
of Cordova, shortly after which commences
what is called the Travesia, a vast sandy zone
thirty to forty leagues in breadth, for the most
part covered with a saline efflorescence, and producing
a salsola, from the ashes of which the inhabitants
extract soda. It borders the Sierra de Cordova
to the north, and extends west as far as La Rioja,
running southward nearly to San Luis. In this
arid district the sultry heat of the north wind,
which is very prevalent in the summer season, is
almost insufferable.</p>

<p>My intelligent correspondent Dr. Redhead, who
has lived for more than a quarter of a century in
the upper provinces, and to whom I am indebted
for some of the most valuable of my information
respecting them, speaking of its geological appearance,
observes in one of his letters how forcibly he
had been led to conjecture that the southern part of
the province of Santiago must once have been a sea-coast.
"Its sandy hillocks, he says, always reminded
him of those on the shores of Flanders:"&mdash;certain
it is, that throughout the whole extent of this sandy
zone, from Ambargasta to Noria, the level of the
country becomes very much depressed, and falls very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
nearly to that of Buenos Ayres; thus in the very
heart of the continent, at a distance of 700 miles
direct from the sea, we have a considerable tract of
land hardly elevated above its immediate shores.</p>

<p>The following table of barometrical observations,
taken by Dr. Redhead, will not only show the variations
in the height of the country intervening between
Buenos Ayres and Santiago, but also of that
to the northward, along the high road, as far as
Tupiza in Peru:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;At Buenos Ayres the mean of the barometer for the month of
March, 1822, was 29&middot;61.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>In the upper parts of the Sierra de Cordova
granite everywhere breaks through the surface, and
innumerable fragments of it may be traced in the
descent to the Travesia, whilst beyond that sandy
zone there is not a vestige of it throughout the rest
of the road to Potosi, the formation the whole way
being of blue argillaceous schist and slate, with
occasional strata of limestone and red sandstone.
In the neighbourhood of Potosi, however, and on
the tops of some of the highest mountains in its
vicinity, Helms tells us that he fell in with a pretty
thick stratum of granite pebbles rounded by the
action of water. How, he says, could these masses
of granite have been deposited here? Have they
been rolled hither by a general deluge, or by some
later partial revolution of nature? His astonishment
would have been infinitely greater had he
known that marine shells are to be found on the
lofty mountain of Chorolque (about twelve leagues
north-west from Tupiza, between Salta and Potosi),
the summit of which has been determined by Dr.
Redhead to be 16,530 feet above the level of the
sea.</p>

<p>The word Chorolque is corrupted from Churucolque,
signifying in the Quichua tongue that the
mountain contains silver and shells. The Spaniards,
however, little suspected that the latter were to be
found there, till, in 1826, an enterprising Frenchman
ascended the mountain and brought down
specimens which established beyond doubt the fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>A further study of that language might lead the
scientific inquirer to many an important discovery.
The disposition of the Peruvians for observation is
well known, and their nomenclature of places is
generally expressive more or less either of the
nature of the soil, or some peculiarity attached to it:
thus a person well versed in Quichua is beforehand
aware of what he is to see. Peutocsi, for instance,
difficult to be properly pronounced by an European,
and corrupted into Potosi, signifies, "<i>It is said to
have burst forth</i>:" such must have been their tradition,
which the very appearance of this singular
cone, standing alone and distinct from the system of
mountains which surrounds it, and the hot springs
in its vicinity, would seem to corroborate.</p>

<p>It is in the province of Santiago that the Quichua
is first met with. The Jesuits reduced it to a written
language, and published a grammar and dictionary
of it in Peru.</p>

<p>The city of Santiago is a miserable ill-built place,
containing not more than 4000 souls. It is situated
in lat. 27&deg; 47&acute;, according to Azara, upon the banks
of a considerable river which rises in the territory of
Tucuman, and running south through this province
is finally lost, under the name of the Rio Dulce, in
the great lakes called the Porongos, to the west of
Santa F&eacute;. The whole population of the province
it estimated to be about 50,000; the greater part of
which is much scattered in small villages built along
the courses of this river and of the Salado, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
runs parallel to it, and separates the province on
that side from the gran-chaco, or desert, the low
lands along their banks being better suited for the
pasturage of cattle and for cultivation than the other
parts of the province. The soil there is well adapted
to the growth of wheat, which is said to yield eighty
for one.</p>

<p>In most parts of the province the cactus may be
seen growing to an unusual size, and the cochineal
gathered from it used to form one of the most
valuable productions of this part of the country:
from 8000 to 10,000 lbs. of it were annually sent
to Chile and Peru. Large quantities of wild beeswax
and honey were also collected in the woods
and sent to the other provinces, in which they were
always in demand; but the civil dissensions which
have of late years been so frequent in these provinces
have checked the industry of the people, who have
almost entirely abandoned their old pursuits, and
given up their yearly gatherings of these once valued
productions. This is the more to be regretted as
they are said to be naturally an enterprising and
intelligent race, less given to habitual indolence
than some of the other inhabitants of these latitudes.
The women manufacture ponchos and coarse saddle-cloths,
or blankets, which are sold in great numbers
to the people of Tucuman and Salta.</p>

<p>To the eastward of the river Salado lies the vast
region commonly called the Gran-chaco, or desert,
which extends to the Paran&atilde;, and reaches north as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
far as the province of Chiquitos, solely inhabited
by Indians of various tribes, who, safe in their own
forests and jungles, have there found a refuge from
Spanish domination and persecution. It is through
this territory that the rivers Pilcomayo and Vermejo
wind their tortuous courses to the Paran&atilde; from the
most remote parts of the interior of the Upper
Provinces.</p>

<p>Some way beyond the Salado, about seventy
leagues east from Santiago (in lat 27&deg; 28&acute;), was
found that very remarkable specimen of native iron
which I sent to this country some years ago, and
which is now deposited in the British Museum. Its
existence was first made known by some of the
people of Santiago, who had passed through that
part of the country in their journeys to the forests
beyond to collect honey; and their reports, which
were transmitted to Buenos Ayres, induced the
Viceroy, in 1788, to send Don Reuben de Celis, an
officer in the King's service, to examine it. His
report upon it was published in the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society of London for
1788, and excited much speculation at the time.</p>

<p>As in those times the working of iron was forbidden
in South America, after sundry specimens
of it were forwarded to Lima, to Buenos Ayres, and
to Spain, the remainder lay neglected for many years
in its original site.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the struggle for independence,
however, when the Spanish ships of war blockaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Buenos Ayres, iron, amongst other necessaries, becoming
extremely scarce, the people recollected De
Celis's account, with the reports of the Indians, that
in the same parts there were extensive veins of the
same mineral; and at a great expense the mass in
question was sent for and brought to Buenos Ayres.
By the time it got there the blockade was over; and
as it was evidently much easier to procure iron from
Europe than by a cart-carriage of 1000 miles from
the uninhabited wilds of the Chaco, no further
trouble was taken to determine whether or not the
Indian reports of its being procurable in larger
quantities were true or not. By way of experiment
a pair of pistols were manufactured from it, which
were sent as a present to the President of the
United States, and what remained was placed at
my disposal by the Minister of Buenos Ayres on the
occasion of my signing the treaty with him in 1825,
which recognised on the part of Great Britain the
political independence of his country. I sent it to
Sir Humphrey Davy to be placed in the British Museum,
hoping that he would himself have analysed
it, and given his opinion respecting its supposed
meteoric origin. The analysis I believe was never
made, owing to his death, which occurred very
shortly after the arrival of the iron in this country.</p>

<p>It seems, however, to have been assumed here that
this iron, as a matter of course, is meteoric, because
it contains those admixtures of nickel and cobalt
which accompany other known meteoric productions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
It appears to me that the hypothesis is not very
satisfactorily or conclusively made out.</p>

<p>The mass I sent home weighs about 1400 pounds,
and, making allowance for what may have been
taken from it at Buenos Ayres, may probably when
it arrived there have been not much less than a ton
weight. Now De Celis estimates the mass he examined
to have been about fifteen tons weight, and
of much larger dimensions: either this therefore is
only a fragment of what he particularly described,
or it is another which has been found in the same
part of the country, and if so, is corroborative of the
Indian accounts of there being more in the vicinity.
This was the opinion of Dr. Redhead, who, in writing
to me on the subject, says, "The native iron found
in Santiago is not a single mass, as has been said;
there are several, and the most recent accounts
describe them as huge trunks with deep roots (I use
the expression of the natives), supposed to communicate
with each other."<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Redhead's observation was caused by a discussion
which arose here upon some other specimens
of native iron, which he had forwarded to me, from
the desert of Atacama, in Peru, and which were
described by the late Mr. Allan in the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1828. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
were analysed by Dr. Turner, who found them to
contain&mdash;</p>

<p>a result which he considered decisive concerning
their origin, because, he says, it differs from any
compound hitherto described in the earth, and corresponds
exactly both in appearance and composition
with other meteoric iron.</p>

<p>But these opinions differ entirely from the belief
of those who procured the specimens.</p>

<p>That iron is found scattered in large quantities
over a plain at the foot of a mountain a little to the
south-west of a small Indian village called Toconao,
ten leagues from San Pedro, the capital of Atacama,
and about eighty from Cobija, on the coast. The
tradition there is, that the fragments have been
thrown out by some volcanic explosion from the
side of the neighbouring mountain, in which the
people of Toconao say there is a large <i>veta</i> of pure
iron. The Indian who collected the specimens which
I sent to this country was employed to <i>catear</i>, or
search for mines; and the nature of his occupation
rendered it requisite for him to be particular in his
observations: his account was, that "they were
taken from a heap of the same nature, estimated at
about three hundred-weight, and that they existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
at the month of a <i>veta</i>, or vein of solid iron, situated
at the foot of a mountain; he called them '<i>reventazones</i>,'
or explosions from the mine, or <i>veta</i>. He
had been charged to bring a piece of the <i>veta</i> itself,
and some of the rock in which it is embedded, but
this he said he could not effect for want of tools; he
therefore contented himself with picking up some of
the pieces that were at the foot of the hill, where
the mouth of the vein opens."</p>

<p>Dr. Redhead says, that in giving him this account
the man endeavoured to give him also some idea of
the direction of the vein in the mountain.</p>

<p>Further inquiries were subsequently made, the
result of which corroborated his testimony. The
alcalde of Toconao, who had been at the place,
stated that the fragments had issued from a cavity
of about fifteen feet diameter, which, from the nature
of the soil, was filling up. This is sandy, and
for three leagues round there is neither wood nor
water nor pasture of any kind. Several persons
in San Pedro, and amongst others one named Gonzales,
who had likewise seen the cavity, gave a
similar account.</p>

<p>The Atacama iron is certainly remarkably similar
to the specimen of that met with by Pallas in Siberia,
which is to be seen in the British Museum, but what
proof is there of that being meteoric?</p>

<p>The Santiago iron differs from them both in appearance.
The Atacama and Siberian specimens
are full of cavities, looking like large sponges or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
scori&aelig;. That from Santiago, on the contrary, is
more like a solid lump of well-kneaded dough.</p>

<p>So long as such specimens were supposed to be of
very rare occurrence, and differing as they do from
the character of all other known minerals, it was not
extraordinary that they should have been ascribed to
an extraneous origin; but now that further discoveries
have proved their existence in all parts of
the world, and that enormous masses of similar iron
have been met with in the northern parts of America,
in Mexico, Columbia, Peru, Brazil,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and the provinces
of La Plata, to speak of that continent alone,
I think we may begin to doubt whether they may
not be <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> productions of our own planet,
instead of bringing them from the moon, or elsewhere.
On this I shall only quote another passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
from the letters of my excellent correspondent, who
took the trouble to institute the inquiries for me as to
the origin of the specimens from Atacama. "Time,"
he says, "may perhaps justify the tradition or
opinion of the Indians relative to the origin of this
iron; nor do I know why we should refuse to Nature
the power of reducing in her laboratory a metal so
easily separated from its combinations by the efforts
of man."</p>

<h3>PROVINCE OF TUCUMAN.</h3>

<p>Forty leagues (post distance) beyond Santiago
del Estero is situated the city of San Miguel de
Tucuman. It stands (in lat. 27&deg; 10&acute;) on an elevated
plain in a position from which the prospect on
every side is delightful; indeed all accounts agree
in describing it as the best situated town in the
republic. The climate, though hot, is dry and salubrious;
and Nature has been so prodigal of her
choicest gifts, that the province of Tucuman well
merits its appellation of the garden of the United
Provinces. The population amounts to about
40,000 souls, of which 7000 or 8000 reside in
the city.</p>

<p>After leaving the travesia of Santiago, the road
ascends a slightly inclined plane the whole way to
Tucuman, the jurisdiction of which commences after
crossing the river Santiago, there called the <i>Rio
Hondo</i>, or deep river, which separates the two provinces,
and is formed by the confluence of many
streams which rise in the mountains to the west.
To the eastward the Salado continues to be the
general boundary-line separating it from the Chaco:
to the north the river Tala divides it from the territory
of Salta; and to the west and south-west the
lofty mountains of Aconquija separate it from Catamarca.
The highest peak of this range is covered
with perpetual snow, and is said to be above 15,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
feet above the level of the sea. It abounds in
mineral treasures, and contains ores of gold, silver,
copper, and lead; but the toil and difficulty attendant
upon mining operations in those parts of
the sierra where they are to be found have caused
them to be much neglected, and the mining, if
mining it can be called, is now confined to a few
wretched people scattered amongst the hills, who
occasionally collect small quantities of silver, which
they bring down to the city for sale. I have had
some of the specimens of silver so collected, which
are singularly rich and beautiful.</p>

<p>The <i>mita</i>, and other oppressive enactments have
will nigh destroyed the unfortunate race whose
forced labour brought to light the mineral wealth
of these regions. The <i>mamelucho</i>, as the gaucho of
Tucuman is called, the horseman of the plains, with
the help of his wife, who makes the greater part of
his clothing, has almost everything he wants about
him. He knows not, and therefore needs not, those
comforts which become wants in less genial climes,
and where civilization is more advanced. Free as
the air he breathes, he gallops over boundless plains
unfettered by the slightest restraint upon his own
inclinations. He has no temptation to quit such a
life for the fatigues and dangers of an occupation
which he considers as degrading,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> to bury him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>self
under ground, and to seek by the sweat of his
brow treasures of which he does not stand in need.
His cattle are the finest in the republic; and the
least possible cultivation and labour is sure to yield
in return not only the necessaries, but what in his
opinion are the luxuries of life.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more luxuriant than the vegetation
in this province; whilst the plains yield corn
and maize, and rice and tobacco, in the greatest
abundance, the base and slopes of the mountain
ranges in the west are covered with noble trees in
every variety, interspersed with innumerable shrubs,
and hung with the most beautiful parasitical plants.
Extensive groves also of aroma and orange-trees
produce a fragrance which adds to the delights of
this favoured region. The sugar-cane grows naturally
in the low lands, and might be turned to
valuable account; the demand for it, however, at
present, is not sufficient to induce the country people
to attend to it. Not so with the tobacco-plant, which
they cultivate and find a ready sale for in all the
adjoining provinces. The people are a well-disposed
hardy race, proud of their beautiful country, and
always ready to take up arms in defence of <i>La
Patria</i>.</p>

<p>It was at Tucuman, in 1816, that a Congress of
Deputies from the several provinces solemnly declared
their independency and separation from Spain.
From 1810 to that period the ruling authorities set
up had been avowedly merely provisional, and all
their acts had been in the King's name, the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
vainly looking forward to the King's restoration for
a redress of their grievances. It is useless now to
say that if the Spanish government had treated them
with kindness and conciliatory measures, they would
have found the colonies abounding in the same loyal
and affectionate feelings for the mother country of
which in other times they had repeatedly given such
striking proofs.</p>

<p>The King was otherwise advised; and the natural
consequence ensued, that the South Americans, who
had acquired a knowledge of their own strength and
importance, simultaneously with the conviction that
they had nothing to hope, and all to fear, from a
return to the rule of the mother country, declared
themselves the arbiters of their own destinies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>


<h3>PROVINCE OF CATAMARCA.</h3>

<p>Catamarca, divided from Tucuman by the sierras
of Aconquija, is one of those subordinate provinces
which, like Rioja, owes its independence rather to its
insignificance and secluded situation than to any
pretensions which the people can have to govern
themselves; properly it should be a dependency of
the government of Tucuman, to which the Congress
annexed it in 1814.</p>

<p>When I applied to the Governor for some general
statistical information as to the extent and resources
of his province, he fairly confessed his own ignorance
and utter inability to answer my queries; much less
was it possible to obtain any satisfactory topographical
data.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the province are estimated at
30,000 to 35,000, of which about 4000 reside in
Catamarca. The valley so called, and in which the
greater part of this population is settled, runs from
north-west to south-east, extending from the confines
of Atacama to those of Rioja. On the eastern side
it is separated from Tucuman first by the sierras of
Ancasti and Ambato, and more to the north by the
lofty chain of Aconquija: it is watered by a river
which holds its course through it (said to have been
once a much more considerable stream than at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
present day), the waters of which are finally lost in
the low sandy plains of the province of Santiago.</p>

<p>The climate is sultry, and the people, at certain
seasons, are very subject to intermittent fevers.
They produce corn and cattle enough for their own
subsistence, and supply the adjoining provinces
largely with their cotton, the quality of that of Catamarca
being in higher repute than their own, for
their domestic manufactures: considerable quantities
of red pepper are also sent from thence to Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p>Catamarca, by the usual track, is about sixty
leagues distant, south-west, from Tucuman. In a
MS. by Dean Funes, in my possession, he places it
in south latitude 28&deg; 12&acute;. The first Spanish settlement
in this part of the country was formed by Juan
Perez de Zurita, in the year 1558. He named it
New England, and the principal town London, in
celebration of the nuptials of his sovereign King
Philip with our Mary. From thence, however, the
Spaniards were shortly after expelled by the native
Indians, and, removing to the valley of Conando,
founded the town of Villagran. That district was
subsequently abandoned from the same cause,&mdash;the
continual hostility of the natives; and the population
was finally settled in the valley of Catamarca.</p>

<p>The Calchaquis, who originally occupied those
parts, were a warlike race, whose dominion extended
from the confines of Peru over all the country lying
between the ranges of the Cordillera on the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
and those of Aconquija on the east. They derived
their name from the valley of <i>Calchaqui</i>, which, in
the Quichua language is strongly significant of the
fertility of the soil; and for a long period they
defended themselves against the Spaniards with an
obstinate bravery, unequalled perhaps in any other
part of South America, excepting Araucania. The
history of those parts for the first century and a half,
indeed, is little more than an enumeration of their
bloody wars with the Spaniards, in which the latter
were often defeated with serious loss, their towns
besieged and destroyed, and they themselves obliged
to fly before the brave defenders of the soil, whom
they drove to desperation by their wanton cruelties
and oppressive treatment. Amongst other instances
of the outrageous and overbearing conduct of the
conquerors which are recorded, one may serve as a
sample, which Funes relates of Don Philip Albornos,
who, being named Governor of Tucuman, some
of the Caciques of the Calchaquis, at the time on
good terms with the Spaniards, repaired to Tucuman
to tender to him their customary tribute
upon his appointment. Upon their arrival, instead
of the welcome they expected, he wantonly ordered
them to be publicly flogged, to have their heads
shaved, and so to be sent back whence they came.
The Calchaquis swore to be avenged: they secretly
sent forth emissaries to rouse all the people of
their tribes, especially those of Andalgala, of Famatina,
of Copoyan, and Guandacol, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
known to be smarting under the yoke of their new
task-masters, for that part of the country was nominally
reduced to subjection by the Spaniards; and
then, with an overwhelming force, at one and the
same time, fell upon Jujuy, Salta, Tucuman, London,
and La Rioja, carrying everywhere desolation,
and sparing not man, woman, nor child. Never were
the Spaniards in those parts reduced to such shifts;
in vain they endeavoured to make peace, the Indians
would listen to no terms, and this war raged for ten
years, with great loss to the Spaniards, and the utter
annihilation of many of their settlements. Nor was
it till a large force could be spared from Peru that
this formidable insurrection was put down.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, once masters again, retaliated as
usual. Many tribes were exterminated; others capitulated
with their conquerors to abandon altogether
their native valleys, and were removed to a distance;
amongst others a people called the Quilmes, inhabiting
a part of the valley of Calchaqui, being reduced
to about 200 families, after a long resistance, were
sent to Buenos Ayres, where the Governor settled
them a short distance from the city, at the place
which still bears their name.</p>

<p>The labours of the Jesuits, however, were eventually
more successful than all the military forces
which were sent against the Calchaquis. The indefatigable
missionaries reduced one tribe after
another to a state of comparative civilization, and
eventually removed the greater part of them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
their native soil to form the nucleus of the Christian
settlements which they were anxious to establish
upon their own plan on the shores of the Vermejo,
amongst the Indians of the Chaco. There they soon
lost all importance, and the hostilities of other Indian
nations, and a dreadful epidemic which broke
out amongst them, in the year 1718, finally put an
end to the existence of a gallant people, who had
not only signalized their name by their successful
wars against the Spaniards, but who, in times long
before, had maintained their independence in spite
of all the efforts of the dynasty of the Incas of
Peru to reduce them to subjection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>


<h3>SALTA</h3>

<p>is the frontier province of the republic to the north;
and follows in geographical succession those of Tucuman
and Catamarca, which bound it to the south
and west. The river Vermejo and its tributary,
the river of Tarija, constitute its limits to the east.
It is divided into the four departments of Salta,
Jujuy, Oran, and Tarija; the latter of which has
been occupied by the Bolivians, apparently with a
determination to maintain possession of it. Deducting
the population of that department, the rest of
the territory of Salta is estimated to contain nearly
60,000 souls. The city of Salta has between 8000
and 9000 inhabitants. It was founded in 1582, by
Don Philip de Lerma, Governor of Tucuman, with
a view to secure the communication between that
province and Peru from being cut off by the hostile
Indians. Its latitude is said to be 24&deg; 30&acute;. Upon
the whole it has a neat appearance, and boasts of
its cathedral and many churches. It is, however,
badly situated in the bottom of a valley, through
which flow the rivers Arias and Silleta, the latter of
which has of late years abandoned its ancient bed,
and seems to threaten at no distant period to burst
over the low marshy grounds upon which the city
stands. Shut in by the mountain ranges in the
neighbourhood, the atmosphere is at certain seasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
charged with miasma, giving rise to intermittent
fevers and agues, which are very general at those
periods amongst the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The form of government in this province, as in all
the rest, is based upon the example of that of Buenos
Ayres; consisting of a popular assembly, which has
the power of electing the Governor. But though
democratic in theory, it is far otherwise in practice:
the lower orders have not the smallest notion of the
real meaning of a representative form of government,
and bow with submission to the dictates of a
patriarchal coterie of influential families, which,
alternately electing and elected, arrange the government
amongst themselves very much as suits their
own convenience and interests. If any appeal to
the people is ever made, it is generally from the
necessity of supporting by a demonstration of brute
force the pretensions of some particular candidate
for power.</p>

<p>Such are these governments in the infancy of
society. One may serve as a sample of the rest,
although local circumstances may have given rise
to slight shades of difference in their appearance.
Salta, as a frontier province, during the struggle
for independence, was much exposed to the vicissitudes
of the war; but this very circumstance roused
the energies of the people, and excited in them a
spirit of improvement which has placed them in
advance of most of the Upper Provinces. The
establishment of a printing-press, from which occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>sionally
a newspaper is produced, and of schools,
in which reading, writing, and the first rules of
arithmetic are taught, are great steps compared
with the state of things under the old regime. The
clergy, too, either from conviction, or the force of
circumstances, are daily becoming more tolerant,
and opinions which in old times it would have been
heresy to think of, are now as freely discussed as at
Buenos Ayres, where religious toleration has become
the law of the land.</p>

<p>From Buenos Ayres, Salta is distant 414 leagues,
by the post road, and so far the journey may be
gone the whole way in a four-wheel carriage;
but beyond Salta this is no longer possible, and the
traveller must mount his mule to traverse the regions
of the Cordillera, which there may be said to
begin in earnest, and the rugged and precipitous
passes through which are quite impracticable by
any other mode of conveyance.</p>

<p>The Salte&ntilde;os boast that within their own territory
they possess every climate, from extreme heat to the
most intense cold; and, consequently, that they can
rear almost every production of nature; for although
directly under the tropic, the mountain ranges rise
in some places to the height of perpetual snow, counteracting
the sun's influence more or less according
to the elevation. Thus whilst in all the department
of Oran, in the east of the province, the tropical sun
has its full influence, under the same latitude in the
west, in the mountain districts of Rosario and Rin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>conada,
the cold is intense. In the intermediate
valleys the climate is temperate and agreeable. It
is in these valleys that the population is chiefly
located: they are for the most part highly fertile,
being watered by many small rivers and streams,
which, running eastward from the mountainous
districts, fall into the Salado and Vermejo, which
have already been described as the principal aqueducts
of these Upper Provinces. Indeed it is in
this province that both these noble rivers may be
said to have their origin, of which I shall venture
to give the following account, chiefly from data published
by Colonel Arenales, son of the late Governor
of Salta, and now at the head of the topographical
department of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>As a general observation it may be stated that
the tributaries of the Salado all run south, whilst
those of the Vermejo will be found to the north of
the city of Salta, as may be seen on reference to the
map.</p>

<p>The sources of the Salado may be traced to
the snowy ranges of Acay, where the river Cachi
rises, about fifty leagues' journey westward of Salta,
running nearly due south, for more than thirty
leagues, through the valleys, successively named
Cachi, Calchaqui, Siclantas, and San Carlos; during
this course it is joined by three smaller rivers from
the west. Six or seven leagues from San Carlos,
the river Santa Maria falls into it from the south.
This river rises in the province of Catamarca, forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
leagues off, running from south to north with little
variation. The road from Salta to Catamarca and
La Rioja follows its course. At the junction of the
Santa Maria the Cachi changes its direction from
south-east to north-east, and takes the name of
Guachipas, from the town so called, by which it
afterwards passes. A little beyond that place the
Silleta falls into it, about sixteen leagues to the south
of Salta. This river rises near the lake del Toro,
to the north-west of Salta, and is augmented by the
Arias, from that city, and by two or three other
minor streams. Thence the Guachipas turns again
south, and, ten leagues below its junction with the
Silleta, crosses the high road from Buenos Ayres,
where it is called "El Pasage." In the summer
season, when the waters are low, its breadth may
be here about 100 yards, and not being then more
than three or four feet deep, it may be safely forded;
but at other seasons when the waters rise, it becomes
a very wide and formidable river, the passage of
which is rendered extremely dangerous, even to
those best acquainted with it, not only from its
increased depth and rapidity, but from the many
large boulders and trunks of trees which are hurried
down by the stream with irresistible violence,
and which carry everything before them.</p>

<p>At those times couriers occasionally pass it swimming,
or holding by the tails of their horses, which
they drive before them. All carriage intercourse is
for the time impossible, and the ordinary traffic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
between Salta and the lower provinces is therefore
as matter of course suspended during the rainy
season. To obviate so serious an inconvenience, in
the time of the Old Spaniards, a survey was made
of this part of the river, and a plan was proposed to
the government for throwing a bridge over a rocky
pass, which, if executed, would have enabled carts
as well as passengers to cross it high and dry at
any season. The materials were at hand, and the
estimate of the whole expense so small that it was
difficult to find an objection to it; on the contrary,
it was unanimously approved; but, as nothing is
done in a hurry in these countries, it was, like many
other most notable projects, postponed, "<i>hasta mejor
oportunidad</i>," till better times, which, unfortunately
for the people of Salta, have never yet arrived.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve leagues below the pass, the river
De las Piedras, the last affluent of any consequence,
falls in; thence the course of the river is easterly
inclining south, as far as Pitos, the frontier fort of
Salta in that direction. In the flat saline country
through which it afterwards runs, its waters imbibe
a brackish taste, from which it takes the name of
the Salado, or the salt river, which it preserves the
whole way to its junction with the Paran&atilde;, near
Santa F&eacute;. I have before stated that this river is
believed to be navigable as high as Matara, in the
latitude of Santiago del Estero.</p>

<p>The Vermejo, the most important of all the affluents
of the Paraguay, is formed by two considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
streams, which may be generally called the rivers
of Jujuy and Tarija, from those two departments
which they respectively drain. At their sources
they are at no great distance from each other, but
descending from opposite sides of a snow-capped
range, the buttresses of which branch out far and
wide to the south and east, they are soon hurried
away in totally different directions; each, however,
finally sweeping round the base of the stupendous
platform above, describes, after a long course,
the segment of a circle, which is rendered all but
complete by the junction of their waters at a point
about sixteen leagues below Oran, whence they flow
together south in one mighty and navigable stream
the whole way to the Paran&atilde;. The name of Vermejo,
or the red river, is derived from the occasional
discoloration of the waters by the red alluvial soil
which is washed into them during the periodical
floods.</p>

<p>With respect to the many minor streams which
fall into the rivers of Jujuy and Tarija, they are for
the most part mere mountain torrents of little importance,
except as adding to their waters, which
finally become navigable below Oran.</p>

<p>The Jujuy river rises near the Abra de Cortaderas,
about three leagues from Colorados, one of
the most elevated points passed by the traveller
on the road to Potosi: from thence the lofty peak
of Chorolque beyond Tupiza, in the north, and
the snowy ranges of Atacama, in the north-west,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
are distinctly visible. The channel of the river
in its descent from this elevated region, the whole
way to Jujuy, is little more than a succession
of precipitous ravines, occasionally swelling into
basins, highly interesting to the geologist, as exhibiting
on all sides evidences of the tremendous convulsions
which at some remote period must have
torn and shaken this part of the continent to its
very foundations. The road to Potosi winds along
it, but it would seem to be a region only suited to
the wild llamas, alpacas, and vicu&ntilde;as, which range
in countless herds over the snowy ranges above,
looking down with apparent surprise on the casual
traveller, who wends his toilsome way through these
rugged defiles. The favourite food of these animals
is the ich&uacute;, a very coarse grass, which is only found
at an elevation little short of that of perpetual snow.
At Jujuy the river turns eastward through a more
open and habitable region, which skirts the southern
base of these mountain ranges, and about twenty
leagues beyond receives the Siancas, or Lavayen, its
most important tributary, which rises in the heights
of San Lorenzo, to the north-west of the town of
Salta:&mdash;it is afterwards joined by the Ledesma and
three or four other minor streams, before it falls
into the Tarija river, as before stated, below Oran.</p>

<p>The course of the Tarija, in the first instance, is
nearly as precipitous as that of the Jujuy, running
through broken mountainous passes; but when it
trends to the south, and receives the Pescado (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
separates the departments of Oran and Tarija), and
shortly after the Senta, it opens into wide and extensive
valleys, traversed by many streams, which,
running down into the main river, irrigate the rich
lands along its shores, and unite with the warmth
of a tropical climate to form one of the most fertile
districts in the world.</p>

<p>These are the principal rivers of this province.
Its productions are as various as its physical features.
In the west the mines of the Cerro de Acay and San
Antonio de los Cobres, have been at times worked
with considerable success; and in the still more elevated
districts bordering upon Atacama, the natives of
Cochinoca, the Rinconada, Cerillos, Santa Catalina,
and Rosario, employ themselves in collecting considerable
quantities of gold from the alluvial deposits
after heavy rains.</p>

<p>It is in those cold regions that the alpacas and
vicu&ntilde;as are found:&mdash;the guanaco also abounds there,
and the beautiful little chinchilla, thousands of
dozens of the skins of which are yearly collected
and sent down to Buenos Ayres for exportation to
Europe.</p>

<p>In the same part of the province, not far south
of La Rinconada, are extensive plains of salt, called
the Salinas of Casabindo, to which the natives
of the adjoining districts resort when the salt is
hard and dry, and cut out large blocks of it with
hatchets, which they load upon their llamas and
asses, and carry to Salta and Jujuy, and other parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
of the province:&mdash;there, also, they collect, in the
same manner, the snow which is used in those
towns for making ices in the summer season. The
eyes of travellers obliged to traverse these inhospitable
wilds are said to be as much affected by the
glare of the sun reflected from these fields of salt, as
from the snow-capped mountains which bound them.
Casabindo is about forty-five leagues east from
Atacama, the intermediate distance being all Cordillera,
and is situated upon the desolate road from
Salta, which is appropriately called <i>El Despoblado</i>.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>In the valleys, further south, of Colalao, San
Carlos, Calchaqui, and Cachi, watered by the
streams which afterwards fall into the Salado, as
already described, large quantities of corn and
maize are grown, with which the rest of the province
is chiefly supplied: the vine is also extensively
cultivated there, from which a good deal of
an ordinary wine is yearly made and drunk in those
parts for want of better.</p>

<p>It was from their rich pastures, however, watered
by the mountain streams, that the Salte&ntilde;os in former
times derived their principal profits. Before the revolution,
and when the upper provinces, which now form
the separate state of Bolivia, were part of the Vice-Royalty
of Buenos Ayres, a great trade was carried
on by the people of Salta in mules, 50,000 or 60,000
of which were annually sold there for the service of
the carriers of Peru:&mdash;these mules were chiefly bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
in the provinces of Santa F&eacute; and Cordova, and sent
to Salta when two or three years old, where, after
being kept for a season or two in the rich grazing
grounds of that province, they were considered
strong enough for the work expected of them in
the severer climate of the Andes. A periodical fair
was held in the neighbourhood of Salta, to which
the purchasers from Peru repaired, and bought the
animals in droves at the rate of fourteen or sixteen
dollars each (five or six more if broken in), about
a third of which was clear profit to the Salte&ntilde;os,
who bought them of the Cordova and Santa Fecino
breeders at a price seldom above ten dollars. These
that reached Lima were worth double the price paid
for them at Salta. A tax, called <i>sisa</i>, of three
quarters of a dollar on each mule, was levied by the
government, the annual amount of which was destined
to the maintenance of the forts upon the frontier, kept
up as defences against the encroachments of the
Indians of the Chaco.</p>

<p>The struggle for independence stopped this traffic,
for the upper provinces and the greater part of Peru
being in possession of the Royalists to the last, all
intercourse with Salta was cut off for many years,
nor has there been any sufficient encouragement to
renew it since the restoration of peace. Peru, however,
must have mules, and it does not appear that
she is likely to be supplied with them from any
other quarter in sufficient numbers.</p>

<p>Proceeding eastward, through the valleys of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Campo Santo, and those watered by the Lavayen
and its affluents, to Oran, and throughout all that
department, a tropical vegetation is found in all its
natural luxuriance.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Forests of noble trees stud the
banks of the rivers, and extend far down the shores
of the Vermejo, valuable not only as timber, but as
producing fruits which may be said to supply the
place of bread and wine to the natives:&mdash;such,
amongst others, is the algaroba tree, a sort of acacia,
from the fruit of which, a large bean growing in
clusters of pods, mixed with maize, the Indians
make cakes; and, by fermentation, produce their
chicha, a strong intoxicating spirit in very general
use. The quinaquina, the palm-tree, and the
plant from which the famous mat&eacute;, or Paraguay tea,
is made, are equally indigenous there, and many
others, as yet only known to us by their Indian
names, which it would be useless to recapitulate.</p>

<p>The cactus, bearing the cochineal insect, and the
aloe are found in every direction:&mdash;from the macerated
fibres of the latter, the Indians of the Chaco
make yarn and ropes, which are found less liable to
rot in water than hemp:&mdash;their fishing-nets are
made of this material, and a variety of bags and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
pouches, for which there is always a demand
amongst their more civilised neighbours: these articles
are variously dyed in indelible colours, prepared
also by the Indians. There is no doubt that
this plant, which grows as commonly in most parts
of South America as the thistle with us, might be
turned, here as elsewhere, to very considerable
account for many useful purposes. I have seen
not only beautiful rope, but very good coarse cloth
manufactured from it; indeed I have now in my
possession some paintings done in Peru upon a canvass
made from it, which could not be distinguished
from any coarse linen of European make.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>At Buenos Ayres, where the hedgerows are
generally formed of the common aloe, I had an
opportunity of trying various experiments with it,
and had some cordage made from it of beautiful
texture and whiteness by some sailors from one
of his Majesty's ships. I also tried my hand at
making pulqu&eacute;, after seeing Mr. Ward's account of
the manner in which it is made in Mexico; but,
though we obtained an abundance of the liquor, following
the process described by him of taking out
the stem as soon as it began to shoot, and collecting
the sap as it accumulated in the socket or basin beneath,
it was never sufficiently palatable to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
tastes to be drinkable; but this probably was from
our want of experience in the mode of preparing it:
however, I have no doubt that consumers enough
might be found of this or any other such beverage
amongst a people who can drink so filthy a preparation
as the chicha, the liquor in common use
amongst the natives of the united provinces,&mdash;one
of the ingredients of which is said to be maize chewed
by old Indian women.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In some of those saline and arid districts, where
no other fresh water is to be found, there grows a
species of the aloe, well known to the natives, from
which, on being tapped by an incision made in one
of the thickest leaves, a clear stream will spurt out
sufficient to allay the traveller's thirst.</p>

<p>In many parts of Oran is found the celebrated
cuca, or coca, plant (<i>Erythroxylon Peruviana</i>), sometimes
called <i>El Arbol del hambre y de la sed</i>,&mdash;"The
tree of hunger and thirst;" to the natives more necessary
than bread. Hungry or weary, with some
leaves of coca to chew, mixed with a little lime or
alkali of his own preparation, the Peruvian Indian
seems to care for no other sustenance:&mdash;he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
swallows it, but is perpetually chewing it, as the
Asiatics do the beetle-nut: give him but his bag
full of this, and at most a little dried maize besides,
and he will undertake the hardest labour in the
mines, and, as a courier, perform the most astonishing
journeys on foot, frequently travelling a hundred
leagues across the snowy and desolate regions of the
Cordillera.</p>

<p>In surveying countries like these, still in their
natural state, it is impossible not to be struck at
every step with the infinite and wonderful variety of
the works of the Almighty, and with the manifest
evidences they uniformly display of an unceasing
and beneficent provision for all the wants of His
creatures, in every clime and under all circumstances.</p>

<p>In the valleys watered by the Jujuy and its tributaries,
as in many other parts of the republic, the
indigo grows wild, and the sugar-cane and tobacco
are extensively cultivated, the two latter being produced
in sufficient quantity not only for the consumption
of the whole of the province of Salta, but
for exportation to the rest of the upper provinces,
and occasionally to Chile. Cotton, also, is grown
there in considerable quantities, and of a quality
which would be prized in the markets of Europe,&mdash;as
indeed would be nearly all the valuable productions
of this highly-favoured region.</p>

<p>Although in this, as in every other part of the
republic, the want of population may be considered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the great drawback to the full development of its
natural resources, the Salte&ntilde;os, and especially those
in the eastern districts of the province, obtain assistance
to a considerable extent in the cultivation of
their lands from the Indians of the Mataco nation,
who live upon the shores of the Vermejo, below the
junction of the Jujuy. These Indians, now an independent
people, acknowledging no other authority
than that of their own Caciques, were in former
times reduced, in a certain degree, to civilised habits
by the Jesuits, the fruits of whose influence are still
perceptible in their occasional intercourse with their
Christian neighbours, amongst whom they repair at
the seasons of sowing and harvest to barter their
service in labour in exchange for articles of clothing,
and beads and baubles for their women. They
are very industrious, and in the allotment of work
will undertake double the daily task of the Creoles:&mdash;the
payment they receive for a month's work is
from ten to fifteen yards of very coarse cloth or
baize, the cost of which at Salta may be about a
quarter of a Spanish dollar, or about a shilling a
yard:&mdash;with this and their food they are perfectly
content, and, at a similar rate, any number of them
might be induced to leave their own haunts periodically
to work in the sugar and tobacco plantations
of the Spaniards. I was told by an Englishman,
long resident at Oran, that many hundreds of them
are yearly engaged at the rate above stated to get in
the crops in the vicinity of that place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>When to this low rate at which productive labour
may be obtained, we add the existence, now indisputably
established, of an uninterrupted navigation
the whole way from Oran to the Paran&atilde;, and thence
to Buenos Ayres, it is impossible not to be struck
with the very great natural advantages possessed by
this province, and with the very small degree of
energy apparently requisite on the part of the natives
to turn them to the fullest account. It is
their own fault alone if the sugars and tobacco, the
cotton, the indigo, and cochineal of Oran, do not
vie with those of Brazil and Columbia in the markets
of Europe. Let the people of these countries
open their eyes to the importance of their own resources,
and let them not imagine that they themselves
are incapable of calling them into action:&mdash;unfortunately,
such a feeling is one of those curses
to the country engendered by the old colonial
system of Spain, and which has the effect, to a lamentable
extent, of counteracting that spirit of self-confidence
and exertion which, on every account, is
called for on the part of the inhabitants of these
countries under their new political condition. It is
this feeling which has led them to turn their eyes to
the formation of companies in Europe as the best
mode of bringing their fertile lands into notice and
cultivation,&mdash;an erroneous notion which cannot too
soon be set right. I do not say that in the temperate
climate of Buenos Ayres European labourers
may not be employed to advantage; but when it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>comes
a question of sending them into the tropical
regions in the heart of the continent, whether as
agricultural labourers or miners, I am satisfied that
the experiment would only end in utter disappointment
to all parties. In the first place, it should be
borne in mind that, to ensure in Europe any sale for
the productions of so remote a country, the cost of
their cultivation must be extremely low, as it appears
to be at present; but what labourer from Europe
would be satisfied with anything like even double
the ordinary remuneration for daily labour in that
part of the world? Supposing him, however, to be
conveyed thither, and to be contented, for a time,
with the abundance of the necessaries of life around
him, what does he know of the culture of tropical
productions, the chances being that he never saw a
sugar-cane or a cotton plant in the whole course of
his life? But, what is of more consequence, how
long will his physical powers last in a climate, the
heat of which will be almost insufferable to him, and
in which the very indulgence of his own ordinary
habits will soon undermine his constitution and destroy
all his energies? Of the hundreds of Beresford's
and Whitelock's men, who remained in the
country after the evacuation of Buenos Ayres by the
British forces, how very few were afterwards to be
met with who were not sunk to the lowest scale of
misery and moral degradation!</p>

<p>In tropical climates I am satisfied that Europeans
will never be able to compete in amount of daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
labour with the natives: on the contrary, wherever
the trial has been made, the Indian labourer has
been found capable of enduring an infinitely greater
degree of bodily exertion than the most robust
European. It is hardly credible, indeed, what these
people will go through. In the mines especially,
where the amount of their daily work, and the loads
they are capable of sustaining, have excited the astonishment
of every one who has paid the slightest
attention to the subject. The stoutest of the
Cornish miners who accompanied Captain Head in
his visit to the mine of San Pedro Nolasco, was
scarcely able to walk with a load of ore which one
of the natives had with apparent ease brought out of
the mine upon his shoulders, whilst two others of
the party who attempted to lift it were altogether
unable to do so, and exclaimed that it would break
their backs.</p>

<p>In these observations I allude of course to the
labouring class,&mdash;I speak of hands not heads, for I
fully agree in the necessity of introducing improvements
in the cultivation of the native products,&mdash;which
improvements will assuredly be best introduced
by foreigners qualified by experience in other
countries to superintend and direct those processes,
both of cultivation and after preparation, which may
be requisite to ensure their immediate sale in the
foreign markets for which they are destined. Such
persons, perhaps, would be best sought for in the
East or West Indies or Brazil; and, no doubt, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
would not only benefit themselves but their employers
by introducing into these new countries the
results of their practical experience elsewhere. It
is to foreigners, also, that the natives must look to
instruct them in the use of steam-vessels, upon
which, after all, the future advancement of these
remote countries in wealth and civilisation will so
mainly depend.</p>

<p>I will only add to the observations which I have
already made upon this subject, my conviction that
if the governments of Buenos Ayres, Santa F&eacute;,
and Corrientes would but unite in a sincere determination
to give a fair trial to the experiment, men
would be found at Buenos Ayres who would desire
no better than to be employed on such a service:&mdash;as
to any opposition Dr. Francia might offer to
it, it is not worth a moment's consideration.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Give
an English midshipman, of sufficient experience, an
armed steamer and a picked crew, either of his own
countrymen or North Americans, to whom he might
add some of the excellent sailors of Paraguay, and I
am quite sure he would carry a cargo from Buenos
Ayres up the Vermejo in perfect safety to Oran,
despite of Dr. Francia or any such bugbear. This,
however, is an object which must have the cordial
support and co-operation of the ruling powers. If
they shut their eyes to the importance of its success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
it would be labour thrown away for any individual
to volunteer the attempt.</p>

<p>The government of Buenos Ayres, as the authorities
charged with the general interests of the Republic,
from their habitual intercourse with the
people of other countries, ought to be fully able to
appreciate the immense benefits which steam-navigation
has produced elsewhere, and how greatly it has
tended to promote the prosperity and civilisation of
other nations. It is in their power to extend those
blessings to their own countrymen in the heart of
the South American continent, and to produce a
really United Confederation of the Provinces, instead
of that which is now little more than nominal, from
the vast distances which intervene, and operate as
a bar to almost any intercourse between them.</p>

<p>With the establishment of steam-navigation, distance
will cease to be distance, and the upper provinces
will find a cheap and ready vent for an
abundance of productions which are now not worth
the heavy expenses of sending down by land-carriage
to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>It is a grave question, deserving the most serious
attention of those to whom the government of these
countries is at present intrusted, and in the early
solution of which, perhaps, their future political
destinies are involved to an extent far beyond the
comprehension of any casual observer.</p>

so perfectly free from any mixture of common soil as to produce no
vegetation whatever, but was covered with a complete coating of rust
or oxide of iron. The hill is so lofty and steep that its top was not
accessible; but from its more elevated parts nodules of corroded
metal had rolled down, and greatly embarrassed the road: at the
foot of the mountain the soil is red clay mixed with ponderous brown
dust. As we advanced the metal seemed to become less pure, until,
after an extant of two leagues and a-half, it altogether vanished, and
was succeeded by the common clayey land, &amp;c. I had often heard
of this immense mass of metal, but none of the reports had presented
any adequate picture of it to the imagination. The very core of the

iron, in tables; and it is so free from alloy as to produce when smelted
ninety-five per cent. of pure metal."</p></div>

<p>The towns of San Luis, San Juan, and Mendoza,
with their several jurisdictions, each of which is
now considered a separate province, in the time
of the Viceroys were subject to the Intendency
of Cordova. In 1813, by a decree of the National
Congress, they were separated from that government,
and formed into a distinct province, under
the denomination of the Province of Cuyo,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
which Mendoza was made the capital; but in this,
as in the other divisions of the republic enacted
about the same time, the bonds were too loosely
knit to resist the shocks of party struggles and
domestic convulsions; and this arrangement, though
wisely planned, fell with the dissolution of the Congress
at Buenos Ayres which created it.</p>

<p>But for the cabildos and municipal institutions
which still existed in most of the principal
towns of the interior when the metropolitan government
was dissolved, in 1820, I believe every semblance
of a legitimate authority would have ceased.
They retained to a certain extent powers not only
for the preservation of the public peace, but for the
administration of justice; and although perhaps,
under the circumstances, they afforded facilities for
the establishment of the federal system in opposition
to a more centralised form of government, there is
no doubt they saved the insulated towns in the
interior from worse consequences. Those institutions
were by far the best part of the colonial
system planted by the mother country, and they
were framed upon principles of liberality and independence
which formed a very singular exception to
her general colonial policy. I doubt whether those
which in most cases have been substituted for them
have been so wisely cast, or are so suitable to
the state of society in those countries. The people
at large were habituated and attached to them, and
had they been retained, with some reforms adapting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
them to the new order of things, they might have
been made the very best foundations for the new
republican institutions of the country. But the
truth was, they were essentially too democratic for
the military power which arose out of the change;
they succumbed to that, and the people, having no
real voice in their new governments, made no struggle
to preserve them.</p>

<h3>SAN LUIS.</h3>

<p>Of all the petty governments of the interior that
of San Luis is one of the most wretched. The
population, estimated at from 20,000 to 25,000
souls, is thinly scattered over the estancias, or cattle-farms,
at very long distances from each other,
where they lead a life so far removed from anything
like civilised society, that it may be doubted if their
condition is really much better than that of the
wild Indians, of whom they live in such continual
dread, and against whose fearful inroads their miserable
provincial authorities can afford them no efficient
protection. Their independence and weakness
is a serious evil to the whole republic, which
is in consequence of it left defenceless on its most
assailable side. The provinces of Cordova, Santa
F&eacute;, and Buenos Ayres, are obliged to maintain each
a separate militia to protect their frontiers thus left
open to the savages; and the most important of all
the communications in the republic, the road from
Buenos Ayres to Mendoza, is constantly unsafe
from the total absence of all means on the part of
the government of San Luis to make it otherwise.
Every year this state of things goes on the evil
consequences become more manifest; and, unless the
ridiculous independence of some of these insulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
townships be put an end to by their re-annexation
to their old provincial capitals, not only must their
own interests be annihilated, but those of the republic
at large must materially suffer. It is idle to
look for any improvement under the present system,
which can only lead to the diffusion of ignorance
and moral degradation, if the wretched population
does not altogether disappear under it.</p>

<p>The straggling mud-built town of San Luis de
la Punta, which gives its name to the province,
contains about 1500 inhabitants, all miserably poor.
Bauza places it in lat. 33&deg; 17&acute; 30", long. 65&deg; 46&acute; 30".
It is prettily situated on the western slope of one
of a group of hills, which appear to be the last
knolls of the Sierra da Cordova. Dr. Gillies gives
it 2417 feet above the level of the sea, by barometrical
observation, a greater elevation than the
traveller from the pampas perhaps would imagine.
There is, however, a splendid prospect from it; the
great saline lake of Bevedero glistening at a distance,
and the interminable plains stretching away
to the south, covered with a rich vegetation, brilliant
with gaudy flowers, amongst which the bulbous
plants are strikingly conspicuous.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Towards sunset, the Cordillera, capped with snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
is often visible, though above 200 miles distant. It
has been generally supposed to be Tupungato which
is thus seen; but Tupungato does not rise above
the limit of perpetual snow,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and is often entirely
free from it; is it not more likely therefore to be
Aconcagua, which Captain Fitzroy found to attain
the enormous elevation of 23,200 feet, upwards of
2000 higher than the famous Chimborazo? The
direct distance differs very slightly of either from
San Luis, Tupungato is 213, and Aconcagua 216
geographical miles from it; the latter being about
50 miles to the north of the other.</p>

<p>The gold-mines of San Carolina are about sixty
miles to the north of San Luis, in the mountains;
they have long since been filled with water, and,
as there are no capitalists or machinery to drain
them, they are no longer worked, but the people of
the hamlet wash and sift the alluvial soil collected
at particular places (the lavaderos) in the neighbourhood,
and so collect every year a quantity of gold in
dust and small bean-like lumps, which they call <i>pepitas</i>.
According to the official returns in the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
of Spain's time, the produce of one year, on which
duty was paid, was about 150 lbs. At present the
people take little trouble to collect more than is
absolutely necessary to enable them to purchase at
San Luis the few articles of clothing and horse-gear
which they require; if anything, they are even
worse off than the gauchos upon the estancias.
Captain Head paid them a flying visit, and has
described the wretched poverty in which he found
them.</p>

<p>Originally, and before the erection of Buenos
Ayres into a Vice-Royalty, the province of Cuyo was
subject to the government of Chile, of which San
Luis was at that time the frontier-town to the eastward,
and the place where the Captains-General in
consequence first received the honours due to them
when they crossed the pampas from Buenos Ayres
to take possession of their government. It takes its
name from Don Luis de Loyola, a Governor of
Chile, who founded it in the year 1596.</p>

<p>By the post-road it is 226 leagues distant from
Buenos Ayres, and 84 from Mendoza; and it is the
only place that exceeds the description of a straggling
village throughout the whole distance. The
road which runs through it has been often described
by those who have crossed the pampas in the last
twenty years, and they have left little to say about it.
By all accounts it seems to be a most uninteresting
one; and the grand object, therefore, is to get over
it with the greatest possible expedition. The more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
common mode of performing the journey is on
horseback; but this is necessarily attended with
great fatigue, and he must have an iron constitution
who attempts it; but if he can live upon meat yet
warm with life, or barely toasted over a gaucho fire,
dispense with bread, drink brackish water, and sleep
as a luxury upon the ground in the open air, in spite
of bugs as big as beetles, which will suck him like
vampires, his saddle for a pillow, and the sky for his
covering, and with such fare gallop a hundred miles
a day, he may, barring accidents, reach Mendoza in
about ten days. He will find no temptation to loiter
on the way, though much to make him wish to reach
his journey's end.</p>

<p>There are post-houses, or stations, along the whole
line of road, where relays of horses may be had;
wretched animals in general, to all appearance,
though the work they will sometimes do is almost
incredible, and that of course entirely upon green
food; it is true their gaucho riders never spare them,
and their tremendous spurs, reeking with blood when
they dismount, but too cruelly indicate in general the
goad which has urged them on. Unlike the Arab
or the Cossack, the gaucho seems to have no kind
feeling whatever for his horse; the intrinsic value
of the animal being of no importance, if he drops on
the way his rider cares not, he lassoes and mounts
another beast, and abandons the exhausted one to
the condors and vultures, always on the look-out for
such a chance, and which will tear the flesh from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the poor brute's bones as soon as they find he has
not strength enough left to shake or kick them off.
The mares lead a better life, being kept entirely for
breeding; and custom is so strong that no consideration
would induce a gaucho to mount one. The
pampa Indians have the same feeling, but they keep
them for food as well as breeding; mare's flesh by
them is preferred to all other, indeed it is their ordinary
food.</p>

<p>But it is not absolutely necessary to go through
the fatigue of riding on horseback across the pampas,
and, for those disposed to consult their ease, an admirable
sort of carriage may be had at Buenos
Ayres, called a galera, in appearance more resembling
a London omnibus than any other carriage I
ever saw; it is swung upon hide ropes, and is of
light though very strong construction; and in this
the journey as far as Mendoza may be performed in
fourteen or fifteen days without difficulty. At the
same time that Captain Head started to ride on
horseback across the pampas, another friend of mine,
with four or five persons in his suite, who was desirous
to combine as much comfort as possible with
such an undertaking, left Buenos Ayres in the sort
of carriage I have described; he had besides with
him a cart on two wheels, for the conveyance of
baggage, bedding, cooking utensils, &amp;c., and much
such a supply of <i>stock</i> as people would lay in for a
voyage by sea of two or three weeks' duration. On
reaching Mendoza, he sent me an account of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
journey, from which I extract the following, for the
benefit of those disposed to follow his example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">

<i>"Mendoza, December, 1825.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"We reached this place on the morning of the
eighteenth day from our leaving Buenos Ayres.
H&mdash;d, who started on horseback at the same time,
did it in nine, but with so much fatigue as to be
obliged to lie up for some days afterwards to recruit.
We might easily have done it in our carriage
in fourteen or fifteen, for we galloped nearly
the whole way, as he did, but for the tiresome stoppages
we were continually obliged to make in order
to repair our cart; these kept us half a day at one
place, one day at another, and two whole ones at
San Luis. Though you laughed, as well you might,
at our set-out, and at the appearance of our galera
and caratillo, stuffed with my manifold preparations
for personal comfort, I can truly say, now the expedition
is over, that of all carriage contrivances the
galera is infinitely the best calculated for an excursion
across the pampas; ours was remarkably easy
over the roughest roads, capable of resisting all injury
from them, and its high wheels well adapted for
preventing our sinking in the quagmires, whilst it
formed a comfortable bedroom at night. Of the caratillo
I cannot speak favourably:&mdash;from its construction
it was not suited to keep pace with the galera;
two galeras would be better, especially if there were
ladies of the party, in which case one might be fitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>especially for their convenience, with couches for
sleeping, &amp;c. The pies and provisions might be
stowed away in lockers, as the sailors would call
them, made for the purpose; and the more good
things in the shape of eatables and drinkables
you can get into them the better, unless you
have the stomach of an ostrich to digest what the
gauchos offer you. The filth of the post-houses
is beyond description, dirt and vermin of every
kind in them, and no accommodation of any sort
for the traveller; even our peons preferred sleeping
in the open air, and you would not suspect them
of being over nice; I never in my life saw such a
set of wild devils.</p>

<p>"The country is more uninteresting than any I
ever travelled over, in any quarter of the globe. I
should divide it into five regions:&mdash;first, that of
thistles, inhabited by owls and biscachas; secondly,
that of grass, where you meet with deer and
ostriches, and the screaming horned plover; thirdly,
the region of swamps and bogs, only fit for frogs;
fourthly, that of stones and ravines, where I expected
every moment to be upset; and, lastly, that of ashes
and thorny shrubs, the refuge of the tarantula and
binchuco, or giant bug.</p>

<p>Its geological aspect differed somewhat from what
I expected. I should say that, to the north and
south of Mendoza, there have been volcanoes, the
eruptions from which have covered the country
(perhaps the bed of a sea) with ashes as far as San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Luis: the peculiar soil so formed, combined with
the effects of climate and the salt lakes, may perhaps
account for the particular species of thorny plants
which are undescribed and confined to this region.
The mountain streams, overflowing the saline lakes,
are the origin of the vast swamps between San Luis
and the Rio Quarto; and the decomposed granite
and gneiss from the Sierra de Cordova, gives rise to
the difference in the soil, and to its elevation along
the Rio Tercero."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>


<h3>MENDOZA.</h3>

<p>The province of Mendoza occupies a space of
something more than 150 miles from north to south,
along the eastern side of the Cordillera of the
Andes, and nearly an equal distance from east to
west, measured from the Desaguadero to the central
ridge of the Andes. The northern boundary is
formed by a line passing east and west through the
post station of Cha&ntilde;ar, about eighteen miles north
of the city, which divides it from the jurisdiction of
San Juan. To the south the nominal frontier line
is the river Diamante, although lands beyond that
river have been purchased from the Indians, which
are likely, perhaps, to become some of the most valuable
of the province, especially for the purposes of
cattle breeding, for which those in the vicinity of
Mendoza are not suitable.</p>

<p>The river Desaguadero is the divisional line between
the provinces of San Luis and Mendoza:&mdash;this
river is the drain of a singular chain of lakes
known by the name of Guanacache, formed by the
confluence of the river Mendoza, which runs into
them from the south, and the San Juan river, which,
after passing the town or city so called, is discharged
into them from the north. The Desaguadero, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
receiving these rivers, runs first in an easterly direction,
and afterwards south, into a vast lake called the
Bevedero, below the town of San Luis:&mdash;a portion,
also, of the waters of the river Tunuyan are lost in
the same great sack-like lake, which thus becomes
the reservoir of the greater part of the streams which
issue from the Andes between the thirty-first and the
thirty-fourth degree of latitude. It is said that in
old times the Tunuyan also, like the rivers of Mendoza
and San Juan, had no other outlet, but that
river, at a later period, opened for itself a new
channel, and though a portion of its waters are still
carried into the Bevedero, the greater part of them
turn off to the south before reaching it in a stream
called the Rio Nuevo by Bauza, and the Desaguadero
by Cruz,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> which runs in that direction a considerable
distance, till the Diamante and Chadi-leub&uacute;
rivers join it, and together they form another great
inland water without any outlet, called the Urr&eacute;-lauquen,
or Bitter Lake, from its extreme saltness,
as described in chapter eight. The account of this
lake given to Cruz by the Indians who accompanied
him in his journey across that part of the Pampas
in 1806, has been verified of late years by General
Aldao, who personally examined it in an expedition
which he commanded against the savages in 1833,
when he rode round it, and ascertained that it had
no outlet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>The river Tunuyan rises from the base of the
mighty mountain of Tupungato, and at first runs
south through a wide and rich valley in the Cordillera;
passing eastward of the volcano of Mayp&uacute;,
or Peuquenes, it afterwards finds its way through
the eastern chain of the Andes by a deep chasm or
opening, which it seems to have burst for itself
through the mountains seven or eight miles below
the Portillo Pass, and nearly opposite to where the
Mayp&uacute; leaves the Cordillera on the western side:
thence its course through the plains is north, and
afterwards eastward, in the direction of the great
lake Bevedero, as already stated.</p>

<p>It would seem as though Nature herself had expressly
directed the course of these rivers, viz., the
Mendoza, Desaguadero, and Tunuyan, in such a
way as to facilitate to the inhabitants the means of
artificially irrigating their lands, which, from the
quality of the soil, and the rarity of rain, would be
otherwise barren and unproductive<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>:&mdash;as it is, the
quantity of lands artificially watered by ducts from
the rivers Mendoza and Tunuyan is estimated at
about 30,000 square leagues, and these lands, which
are arid and barren when not so watered, become,
under regular irrigation, uncommonly rich and fertile,
yielding frequently, under a very rude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
simple mode of agriculture, more than a hundred-fold.
Wheat, barley, and maiz are thus grown;
besides which there are extensive vineyards
and orchards, and grounds covered with lucern
grass for the fattening of cattle,&mdash;all regularly enclosed,
and walled in with thick mud walls, called
<i>tapiales</i>.</p>

<p>The products of the province are wine, brandy,
raisins, figs, wheat, flour, hides, tallow, and soap,
which last is made from a species of barilla, which
abounds in most parts of it:&mdash;a considerable portion
of these is exported to Chile and to the provinces
of Cordova, San Luis, and Buenos Ayres. The
quantities so disposed of will be best understood by
the following official return of the exports for a
single year:&mdash;</p>

<p>In addition to these native products, the mineral
riches of the province are various and valuable.
The silver mines of Uspallata have at times been
very productive, and in other parts of the same
range veins, both of silver and copper, are known to
exist, though want of capital and labourers has
hitherto prevented their being opened. With respect
to the working of these mines by English
companies, and in the English manner, the best
opinions seem to agree that it would not answer to
make the attempt.</p>

<p>Mr. Miers carefully examined the mines at Uspallata,
and has given a particular account of the
mode in which they are worked by the natives, and
of the process resorted to for separating the silver
from the ore. At the time he visited them they
were not yielding more than two marks per caxon:<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
a very low average, upon which he has taken the
trouble to make calculations to show that the English
mode of smelting can never be brought into
competition with the process of amalgamation as
practised in South America. He says,&mdash;"To ensure
economical results the aid alone of the people
of the country, as well as the application of their
peculiar habits and management, must be resorted
to: wherever English improvements are attempted
to supersede the old methods, such trials would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
attended with loss. "No one," he adds, "can doubt
but that in the barbarous mode of operation followed
in Chile great loss of product is occasioned; but
when this loss is placed in competition with the increased
cost of labour, materials, and management
necessary to ensure a greater amount of produce, the
inference is irresistible that it is better to put up
with this loss than to expend a sum of money far
beyond the value of what can be obtained by adopting
the improved methods used in countries where
facilities abound which can hardly be procured at any
price in Chile and La Plata."</p>

<p>Captain Head, after seeing them, came to a similar
conclusion: he considered that, although they might
yield a liberal return under the more economical
plan of employing native labourers properly directed,
and at the ordinary low rate of wages paid for such
labour in that part of the country; from the want of
water, wood for fuel, and pasturage for cattle throughout
the region in which they are situated, they would
not repay the cost of working them by machinery, or
by an English establishment.</p>

<p>In all this part of the Cordillera is to be found an
abundance of limestone, gypsum, alum, mineral pitch,
bituminous shales with appearances of coal in many
places, slates, and a variety of saline deposits, amongst
others common and Glauber salts.</p>

<p>The same metalliferous chain of the Andes extends,
according to Gillies, with little interruption,
from Chile to Peru, and contains the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
of the gold and silver mines yet known on the
eastern ranges of the great Cordillera, including,
besides those of Uspallata, the mines of the province
of San Juan, and further north those of Famatina
in La Rioja. It is separated from the central ridge
of the Andes by an extensive valley, or succession of
valleys, running northwards from Uspallata, through
which it is said that an ancient road of the Peruvians
is to be traced at the present day nearly to
Potosi; a point well worth the attention of the antiquarian,
and of great interest, as connected with
the state of civilization which the aborigines had attained
before their conquest by the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The population of the province of Mendoza is calculated
to be from 35,000 to 40,000 souls, about a
third of which is resident in the city and its immediate
vicinity. The executive power is vested in a
Governor, periodically chosen, as in the other provinces,
by the Junta, or Provincial Assembly.</p>

<p>A visible improvement has taken place in the
condition of this people in the last twenty years;
for, although at so vast a distance from the Capital,
like Salta, its position as a frontier town has
given it some special advantages: it has led to communications
with foreigners, and to a traffic with
Chile and with Buenos Ayres, which, by teaching
them the value of their own resources, has roused a
sort of commercial spirit amongst the inhabitants,
and has stimulated them to more industrious habits.
The government has taken pains to establish schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
for the education, of all classes, and the setting up
of a printing press, from which has issued an occasional
newspaper, has been of great use, not only
in opening the eyes of the people at large to the
proceedings of their own rulers, but in furnishing
them with some notion as to what is going on from
time to time in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>They are, in general, a healthy and well-conditioned
race: descended many of them from families
originally sent from the Azores by the Portuguese
government to colonise Colonia del Sacramento
on the river Plate, and made prisoners and
settled in those remote parts by Cevallos, during the
war which preceded the peace of 1777. It is probably
much owing to them that the cultivation of
the vine has been so extensively introduced in this
part of the Republic.</p>

<p>The city of Mendoza, which, according to Bauza,
is in south latitude 32&deg; 52&acute;, west longitude 69&deg; 6&acute;;
at an elevation of 4891 feet above the sea, and at
the very foot of the Andes, is shut out from any
view of the great Cordillera by a dusky range of
lower hills which intervene. Its appearance is neat
and cheerful: the houses, for the most part, built
of sunburnt bricks, plastered and whitewashed;
and the streets laid out at right angles, as usual in
that part of the world. It boasts of an Alameda, or
public walk, said to equal anything of the kind laid
out, as yet, in South America:&mdash;it is nearly a mile
long, neatly kept, and shaded by rows of magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
poplars:&mdash;there are seats and pavilions at either
end for the accommodation of the inhabitants, by
whom it is much frequented as a lounge, especially
of an evening.</p>

<p>The climate is delightful and salubrious, and is
remarkably beneficial to persons suffering from pulmonary
affections. The only ailment to which the
people seem more liable here than in the interior is
the goitre, which I suppose may be attributed to the
same causes, whatever they are, which seem to produce
it in almost all alpine districts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>


<h3>SAN JUAN.</h3>

<p>The province of San Juan, which adjoins that of
Mendoza, occupies the space between the great
Cordillera and the mountains of Cordova, as far
north as the Lla&ntilde;os, or plains, of La Rioja. It is
said to contain about 25,000 inhabitants, governed,
at present, like those of Mendoza, and occupied very
much in the same manner, in the cultivation of their
vineyards and gardens, and in agricultural pursuits.
Their exports of brandies and wines to the other
provinces are little short of those from Mendoza, and
the quantity of corn they annually grow has been
estimated at from 100,000 to 120,000 English
bushels. The same lands produce yearly crops
under the process of artificial irrigation from waters
highly charged with alluvial matter. The ordinary
crops are 50 for 1, in better lands 80 to 100, and
in some, as at Augaco, about five leagues to the
north of the city of San Juan, they have been known
to yield 200 and 240. The price in the province is
from one and a half to two Spanish dollars for a
fanega, equal there to about two and a half English
bushels. The wages of a day labourer are from five
to six dollars a month, besides his food, which may
be worth a rial a day more.</p>

<p>In times of scarcity corn has been sent from San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
Juan to Buenos Ayres, a distance of upwards of a
thousand miles; but this can never answer under
ordinary circumstances, from the great expense attending
the land carriage. It is different with the
wines and brandies, which, after all charges, can be
sold in most of the provinces of the interior, and even
at Buenos Ayres, at a fair profit. They are in general
demand amongst the lower orders, and, if pains
were taken with them, might be very much improved.
I have had samples of as many as eight or ten different
qualities, all of them good, sound, strong-bodied
wines, and only requiring more care in their
preparation for market.</p>

<p>In the northern part of this province, in the lower
ranges of the Cordillera, is the district of Jachal, in
which are what are called the Gold Mines:&mdash;they
are, as far as I could learn, much in the same state
as those of La Carolina in the province of San Luis,
already spoken of. Their yearly produce was estimated,
in 1825, at 80,000 dollars, the greater part
of which was sent to Chile to be coined at the mint
of Santiago. The accuracy of this calculation has
been disputed, but, men if true to its fullest extent,
the amount is of no great consequence.</p>

<p>The situation of the city of San Juan is in latitude
31&deg; 4&acute;, according to Molina. Mr. Arrowsmith has
placed it in longitude 68&deg; 57&acute; 30".</p>

<p>The climate is described as truly heavenly, and the
people as a well-disposed race, extremely anxious to
improve both their moral and political condition. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
this they have had chiefly to struggle with the
countervailing influence of an ignorant, vicious, and
bigoted priesthood, which has been greatly opposed
to all innovations:&mdash;the political power, however, of
this class of persons is fast on the wane at San Juan,
as in most other parts of the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>


<h3>PASSES OF THE ANDES.</h3>

<p>I shall conclude this chapter with a list of the
passes across the Andes from the several provinces
of this republic of which I have any account: they
are twelve in number:&mdash;</p>

<p>First.&mdash;The most northerly is a continuation of
the road called the Despoblado, which crosses the
mountainous districts of the north-western part of
the province of Salta by the mines of Yngaguasi to
Atacama.</p>

<p>Second.&mdash;A pass from the province of La Rioja
communicates with Guasco and Copiapo in Chile.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Third.&mdash;Another, further south, leads from the
province of San Juan to Coquimbo.</p>

<p>Fourth.&mdash;That called Los Patos on the north
flank of the great mountain of Aconcagua, descending
into Chile by the valley of the Putaendo, a small
river which joins the larger one of Aconcagua in
the plains below, near the town of San Felipe. It
was by this road that General San Martin made his
celebrated march over the Andes with the army of
Buenos Ayres in 1817, which led to the liberation
of Chile from the Spanish yoke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>
<p>Fifth.&mdash;The pass of the Cumbre by Uspallata,
the road most usually taken by travellers proceeding
from Mendoza to Santiago de Chile, and which has
been very particularly described by several Englishmen,
who have gone that way. Of the published
accounts that of Mr. Miers is, perhaps, the best, as
he had the most opportunities of making it so,
having crossed it no less than four times, once with
his wife, who was taken in labour upon the road.
Lieutenant Brand's is particularly interesting, from
his having crossed at the season when the Cordillera
was covered with snow, which obliged him to proceed
on foot a great part of the way, and to encounter
fearful risks, which he has very graphically
described. The whole distance from Mendoza to
Santiago is 107 post leagues; and the highest part
of the Andes crossed is (by barometrical measurement),
according to Dr. Gillies, 12,530 feet above
the sea:&mdash;Mr. Miers says about 600 feet less. From
the commencement of November to the end of May,
occasionally a few weeks sooner or later, this road
is passable the whole distance on mules:&mdash;for the
rest of the year it is generally closed to all but foot-passengers,
and the crossing is then attended with
considerable danger; many lives have been lost in
attempting it.</p>

<p>A striking object on this road is the splendid
arch called the Inca's Bridge, seventy-five feet over,
which nature has thrown across a ravine one hundred
and fifty feet deep, through which runs the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
river of Las Cuevas. There are natural hot springs
about it, which some persons suppose to have contributed
to its formation:&mdash;it is evident, however, that
some infinitely more powerful agency has been at
work, from the appearance of beds of fossil shells
there at an elevation of 8650 feet above the level of
the present sea.</p>

<p>Sixth.&mdash;About half way over, near the station
called the Punta de las Vacas, a road branches off
to the valley of Tupungato, and afterwards crosses
the Cordillera to the north of the peak so called,
descending on the opposite side into Chile by the
valley of the little river Dehesa, from which it is
called the Dehesa Pass: it is very little used.</p>

<p>Seventh.&mdash;South of the mountain of Tupungato is
the Portillo Pass, which falls into the valley of the
river Mayp&uacute; in Chile with the Rio del Yeso. By
many travellers it is preferred to the high road
by Uspallata, being the shorter way of the two by
twenty leagues:&mdash;it is, however, seldom open longer
than from the beginning of January to the end of
April, the greater elevation of that part of the Cordillera
causing it to be longer blocked up by the
snow.</p>

<p>The way to it from Mendoza runs southward,
parallel to the mountains as far as the estancia of
Totoral, upon the north bank of the river Tunuyan,
distant about sixty-five miles from that city, and
some twenty from the base of the Cordillera:&mdash;thence
the pass bears west-south-west, distant about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
thirty-six miles; the breach in the mountains
through which the Tunuyan runs being plainly visible
to the south of it. This part of the Andes seems
to consist of two great parallel ridges running nearly
north and south, and separated from each other by
the valley of the Tunuyan, the width of which is
about twenty miles, and its elevation above the sea,
where crossed by the road, about 7500 feet. Of
the two ranges the eastern one is the highest, being,
where the road crosses it, 14,365 feet above the
sea:&mdash;this chain extends with little interruption from
the river of Mendoza, southwards, to the Diamante,
a distance of about 140 miles:&mdash;the western, or
Chilian range, where crossed by the road, is not
above 13,200 feet high.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In this part of the Cordillera is situated the volcano
of Peuquenes, or Mayp&uacute;, eruptions from which
have been frequent since the great earthquake which
produced such disturbance in 1822:&mdash;they generally
consist of ashes and clouds of pumice-dust, which
are carried by the winds occasionally as far as
Mendoza, a distance little short of 100 miles. In
crossing from the eastern to the western side of the
valley of the Tunuyan travellers have, at first, the
summit of the volcano concealed from them, but
about half way between that river and the pass of
Peuquenes there is a good view of it eight or nine
miles distant to the south:&mdash;the summit is generally
covered with snow, and cannot be much less than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>15,000 feet above the sea. It is from the pumice-rock
found in this neighbourhood that the people of
Mendoza make basins for filtering the muddy water
of their river.</p>

<p>Eighth.&mdash;To the south of this volcano is situated
a pass called De la Cruz de Piedra, which enters the
Cordillera where a small stream, the Aguanda, issues
from it, about two leagues to the north of the fort of
San Juan:&mdash;it unites with the road by the Portillo
pass on the opposite side of the Andes in the valley
of the Mayp&uacute;.</p>

<p>Ninth.&mdash;Further south one little frequented unites
the valleys of the rivers Diamante and Cachapoal:
this is previous to reaching the volcano of Peteroa,
beyond which are situated the passes of Las Damas
and of the Planchon.</p>

<p>Tenth.&mdash;Of these the Las Damas, or ladies' pass,
enters the Cordillera from Manantial in the valley
of the river Atuel, and descends by that of the
Tinguiririca, which issues from the mountain of San
Fernando:&mdash;this was the pass which M. de Souillac,
in 1805, reported might, at a very small expense, be
rendered passable for wheel-carriages.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Eleventh.&mdash;The road by the Planchon leads to
Curico and Talca, following the courses of the
rivers Claro and Teno:&mdash;on neither of these roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
does the elevation exceed 11,000 feet, or the vegetation
ever cease.</p>

<p>The twelfth pass is that of Antuco, from which
Cruz started in 1806 to cross the Pampas to Buenos
Ayres:&mdash;the road by it to Conception in Chile follows
the valleys of the rivers Laxa and Biobio. To
the south of the volcano in the vicinity of this pass,
which Cruz could not get up, but which has since
been ascended by M. P&aelig;ppig, a German naturalist
(who nearly lost his life in the attempt), lies a ridge
called the <i>Silla Velluda</i>, rising, according to his
estimation, to the height of 17,000 feet, on the rugged
sides of which, below the snow and glaciers, are to
be traced ranges of basaltic columns.</p>

<p>Of the most frequented of these passes, viz., those
by Uspallata and the Portillo, there are, as I have
already said, several accounts in print, but, as I
know of no other Englishman except the late Dr.
Gillies who has examined those of Las Damas and
the Planchon with any attention, I shall here quote
part of a letter which he wrote to me in 1827, giving
an account of a short excursion he made by them in
that year; and I do so the rather because it also gives
some account of the intervening country, which has
never, as far as I know, been described by any one
else:&mdash;</p>

<p>"About the middle of May I returned from an
excursion of ten weeks to the south which I had
long meditated. After reaching the river Diamante,
the southern boundary of the province of Mendoza, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
crossed that river and ascended the Cerro del Diamante,
and at every step found ample evidence of its
volcanic origin: the ascent was covered with masses
of lava, and near the summit with loose pumice.
The upper part of the mountain consists of a ridge
elevated a little at each of the extremities into a
rounded form, on the north side of which, a little
below the summit, is a plateau about 400 yards
in diameter, which undoubtedly has been formerly
the crater of a volcano. The whole mountain appears
to rest on an immense bed of pumice-stone.
On the steep banks of the Diamante opposite to it
such strata are laid open on both sides:&mdash;at one
place on the south bank I traced one great mass of
pumice-rock, 100 feet long and 145 wide, the whole
forming distinct basaltic pillars.</p>

<p>"From this interesting spot we proceeded towards
the mountains of the Andes, and amongst the first
low hills examined several springs of petroleum,
about which it is curious to observe the remains of a
variety of insects, birds, and animals, which, having
got entangled there, have been unable to extricate
themselves:&mdash;so tenacious is this substance that (as
I was assured by an eye-witness) some years ago
a lion was found in the same situation, which had
made fruitless attempts to escape. Following the
base of this lower range southward, after a few
leagues we reached the banks of the river Atuel, a
copious stream much larger than either the river of
Mendoza or the Tunuyan:&mdash;its bed, very unlike that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
of the Diamante, is very little lower than the surrounding
plains, which gradually slope off to the
eastward for twelve or fourteen leagues, as I had an
opportunity afterwards of observing.</p>

<p>"The north bank, where we crossed it, seems admirably
adapted for an agricultural settlement: it is
there that the several roads diverge across the Cordillera
to San Fernando, Curico, and Talca, in
Chile; and to the south into the country of the
Indians. We proceeded from thence towards the
Planchon, along a succession of valleys rich in
pasturage, but very bare of shrubbery: in several
places we saw immense masses of gypsum, and
passed a mountain from which is obtained an aluminous
earth, much used in Chile as a pigment for
dyeing. The pass of the Planchon is along the
north shoulder of a lofty mountain, apparently composed
of sonorous slaty strata. My barometer unfortunately
got out of order before I reached the
highest elevation; but, as vegetation extends to the
top of the pass, it must be considerably lower than
the passes of the Portillo and of Uspallata, on both
of which all vegetation ceases long before reaching
the higher points of the road. The descent from the
Planchon is very rough, and in many places steep:
at a distance of three leagues from the top we reached
our resting-place, surrounded by luxuriant vegetation,
and thence descended to Curico, along a valley
with steep mountains on either side, and through a
continuous thicket of lofty trees and shrubs, amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
which I may enumerate the Chilian cypress, the
quillay, the canelo or cinnamon-tree, the caustic
laurel, a variety of myrtles, a beautiful fascia, and
others no less interesting.</p>

<p>"From Curico we went to Talca, a considerable
town, and thence explored the river Maule, with a
view to its capabilities for navigation. We returned
by Curico to San Fernando, where we re-entered the
Cordillera by the valley of the Tinguiririca to ascend
the pass of Las Damas: the road was very similar
to that we had previously descended from the Planchon
to Curico; but, being much less frequented, it
was in many places difficult and dangerous. In the
upper part of this valley we examined some hot
springs, the temperature of which reached 170&deg; of
Fahrenheit. Thence we were induced to devote two
days to visit a volcano,&mdash;which was described to us
as being in an active state,&mdash;about ten leagues distant:
thither we proceeded by a most rugged and
dangerous path, and reached within half a league of
the summit, when so serious a snow-storm came on,
that we had the mortification of being forced to
return without accomplishing our object; nor had
we any time to lose, for the snow had so completely
obliterated all traces of the way, that our guide was
completely lost, and, but for the observations I had
taken with my compass, I know not how we should
have got back at all. On reaching our mules again,
the weather was so unpromising that we made all
haste to recross the mountains, lest they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
closed against us by the heavy snow which was
falling; this we happily accomplished, and three
days brought us back again to the place where we
had first crossed the Atuel river. After visiting the
extensive saline lakes in that vicinity, from which
the province is supplied with salt, we bent our way
back to Mendoza.</p>

<p>"In this journey I had an opportunity I had long
desired of examining on the Cordillera the plant
from the root of which the natives of Chile obtain
their admirable red dye."</p>

<p>Dr. Gillies, the writer of this letter, passed many
years at Mendoza, where he recovered from a severe
pulmonary affection, and was himself a striking instance
of the beneficial effects of the climate under
such circumstances. Botany was his favourite pursuit;
but he did not confine himself to this, and
never lost an opportunity of collecting useful information
on every other point which fell under his
notice.</p>

<p>His botanical acquisitions were, I believe, chiefly
communicated to Professor Hooker, of Glasgow,
through whom they were occasionally made known
to the public. His collections of the ores of Uspallata
and other parts of the Cordillera were given to
the College Museum at Edinburgh. I am myself
indebted to him for the best part of my information
respecting the provinces of Cuyo. It was through
him I obtained, amongst other curiosities from those
parts, the very remarkable little animal which is
figured in the annexed plate, and which is now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the collection of the Zoological Society of London.
It has hitherto been only found in the provinces of
Cuyo, and even there but rarely: it burrows in the
ground, and in its habits somewhat resembles the
mole, lying dormant during the winter months; the
natives call it the Pichi-ciego. Dr. Harlan, of New
York, was the first to give an account of it, from an
imperfect specimen sent to him from Mendoza; and
he gave it the name of <i>chlamyphorus truncatus</i>.</p>

<p>European naturalists, however, doubted its existence
till the point was settled beyond dispute by the
arrival of my specimen, which fortunately was perfect,
and in an excellent state of preservation. At
the request of the council of the Zoological Society,
Mr. Yarrell drew up a particular account of its
osteology, which was published in the third volume
of their Journal, and from which, with his permission,
I extract the following observations upon its
comparative anatomy.</p>

<p>"From the representation of the skeleton and its
different parts it will be perceived that the <i>chlamyphorus
truncatus</i> has points of resemblance to several
other quadrupeds, but that it possesses also upon each
comparison many others in which it is totally different.</p>

<p>"It resembles the beaver (<i>castor fiber</i>) in the form
and substance of some of the bones of the limbs, in
the flattened and dilated extremity of the tail, and
the elongation of the transverse processes of the
lower caudal vertebr&aelig;, but no further.</p>

<p>"It has much less resemblance to the mole (<i>talpa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Europea</i>) than its external form and subterranean
habits would induce us to expect. In the shortness
and great strength of the legs, and in the articulation
of the claws to the first phalanges of the toes, it is
similar; but in the form of the bones of the anterior
extremity, as well as in the compressed claws, it is
perfectly different; nor do the articulations of the
bones, nor the arrangement of the muscles, allow
any of the lateral motion so conspicuous in the mole;
the hinder extremities of the chlamyphorus are also
much more powerful. It resembles the sloth (<i>bradypus
tridactylus</i>) in the form of the teeth and in
the acute descending process of the zygoma; but here
all comparison with the sloth ceases.</p>

<p>"The skeleton of the chlamyphorus will be found
to resemble that of the armadillo (<i>dasypi species
plures</i>) more than any other known quadruped. In
the peculiar ossification of the cervical vertebr&aelig;, in
possessing the sesamoid bones of the feet, in the
general form of all the bones, except those of the
pelvis, as well as in the nature of the external covering,
they are decidedly similar; they differ, however,
in the form and appendages of the head, in the composition
and arrangement of the coat of mail, and
particularly in the posterior truncated extremity and
tail.</p>

<p>"There is a resemblance to be perceived in the
form of some of the bones of the chlamyphorus
to those of the <i>orycteropus capensis</i> and <i>myrmecophaga
jubata</i>, as might be expected in animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
belonging to the same order. To the <i>echidna</i> and
<i>ornithorhynchus</i> it is also similar in the form of the
first bone of the sternum, and in the bony articulations,
as well as the dilated connecting plates, of the
true and false ribs. It becomes interesting to be
able to establish even small points of similarity between
the most extraordinary quadrupeds of New
Holland and those of South America; that continent
producing in the various species of <i>didelphis</i> other
resemblances to the <i>marsupiata</i>. In the form of the
lower jaw, and in other points equally obvious, the
chlamyphorus exhibits characters to be found in some
species of <i>ruminantia</i> and <i>pachydermata</i>.</p>

<p>"In conclusion I may remark that in the composition
and arrangement of its external covering,
and in its very singular truncated extremity, the
chlamyphorus is peculiar and unique; and if a conjecture
might be hazarded, in the absence of any
positive knowledge of the habits of the animal, it is
probable that it occasionally assumes an upright
position, for which the fattened posterior seems
admirably adapted. It is also unique in the form
and various appendages of the head, and most particularly
in possessing an open pelvis, no instance of
which, as far as I am acquainted, has ever as yet
occurred in any species of mammalia."</p>

<p>Since Mr. Yarrell's observations Dr. Buckland,
in his description of the <i>megatherium</i>, has further
pointed out the resemblances of the chlamyphorus to
that fossil monster.</p>

<p>In a commercial point of view we have only to look
at the map to be satisfied of the great importance of
the geographical position of Buenos Ayres. From
the Amazons along a line of coast upwards of 2000
miles in extent, the River Plate affords the only
means of communicating with all those vast regions
in the interior of the continent comprised between
the Andes and the mountainous districts which bound
Brazil to the west. Not only the provinces of
the Argentine Republic and of Paraguay, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
now independent states of Bolivia and Peru, are as
yet only accessible from the Atlantic through the
Rio de La Plata.</p>

<p>If there is but little intercourse between these
states at present, it must be ascribed to political
causes alone, and to such confined and restrictive
notions as are, perhaps, to be expected from governments
in their infancy.</p>

<p>The people of Bolivia and the eastern districts of
Peru, whose wants from Europe were formerly supplied
through Buenos Ayres, are now under separate
governments of their own, which seem anxious to
display their commercial as well as political independence
of their old connexions by endeavouring
to force the trade through other channels more immediately
under their own control; but, however
desirous those governments may be, under present
circumstances, to establish a direct intercourse with
Europe through their own ports in the Pacific, and
however well adapted those ports may be for the
supply of the provinces upon the west coast of
America, there can be no doubt, so far as regards
all those which lie to the eastward of the Cordillera,
that, whenever the intermediate rivers shall be navigated
by steam, for which they are so admirably
calculated, the people of those vast countries will be
much more easily supplied with all they want from
Europe by inland water-carriage direct from Buenos
Ayres than by the present circuitous route round
Cape Horn, and the subsequent expensive convey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>ance
by mules across the sandy deserts of Atacama,
and the precipitous passages of the Andes.</p>

<p>As these young states acquire some practical
knowledge of their real interests, and advance in the
science of political economy, it may be expected
that they will naturally make such arrangements
amongst themselves for an interchange of commercial
advantages as cannot but prove to their mutual
benefit. And what could be of more importance,
either to Buenos Ayres or Bolivia, or the back
provinces of Brazil, than the establishment of an
internal communication with each other by means of
steam-navigation?</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, the trade of Buenos
Ayres is limited to the supply of the people of her
own provinces. If I may so call those in more immediate
political connexion with her,&mdash;the <i>soi-disant</i>
republic of the Rio de La Plata.</p>

<p>In order to show what may be the extent of that
trade in times of peace and domestic quiet, it is necessary
to go some years back.</p>

<p>From 1821 to 1825 the Republic was in a state of
comparative tranquillity, and the government of
Buenos Ayres in the hands of a provincial administration,
wise enough to see how mainly the prosperity
and importance of their country depended
upon the fostering of its trade, and the establishment
of a commercial intercourse with the rest of the world
upon the most liberal principles. It was during that
interval of repose and prosperity that I first landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
in Buenos Ayres, and found all classes of the people
rejoicing in the blessings of peace.</p>

<p>All the information which it was my duty to
collect tended to show the great commercial capabilities
of the country, and the facilities afforded
by Buenos Ayres as an emporium for the trade
with a very great part of the population of the interior
of South America.</p>

<p>From a variety of documentary evidence in confirmation
of this, which was furnished to me at the
time, both by the British merchants and by the local
authorities, I shall in the first instance quote the
returns for the year 1822, as exhibiting the nature
and amount of the trade of Buenos Ayres under the
circumstances of undisturbed peace to which I have
referred&mdash;that is, the trade of Buenos Ayres independently
of the supply of any part of Peru,
Bolivia, or Paraguay.</p>

<p>And first, with regard to the import trade:&mdash;</p>

<p>From a return furnished by the custom-house at
Buenos Ayres of all their imports from foreign
countries in the year 1822, it appears that they
amounted to 11,287,622 Spanish dollars, according
to their official valuation, which, generally speaking,
may be considered to be about twenty per cent.
below the wholesale prices in the market.</p>

<p>This amount was computed to be made up from
the several foreign countries as under, viz:&mdash;</p>

<p>of which about 1,323,565 dollars were afterwards
reshipped for ports on the neighbouring coast of
Brazil, Monte Video, Chile, and Peru.</p>

<p>The important proportion of the British trade in
this statement is very manifest; it amounts in fact
to as much as the trade of all other foreign countries
with Buenos Ayres put together. Comparing it
with the importations in the most liberal period of
the Spanish colonial system, it is more than double
the average value<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> of the whole yearly imports into
the Vice-Royalty, for the supply, not only of the
provinces immediately attached to Buenos Ayres, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
of all Upper Peru and Paraguay, containing a population
numerically threefold that of the present republic
of the Provinces of La Plata.</p>

<p>At that period British cotton manufactures were
unknown at Buenos Ayres; silks from Spain, and
French and German linens, alone were in use, the
high prices of which generally confined them to
the rich, the poorer classes being miserably clad
in the coarse manufactures of the interior. It is
true that in some parts of Peru and Paraguay the
native manufactures were brought to some perfection,
but it was by so tedious a process, that if they
reached any degree of fineness they were rather
articles of luxury and curiosity than of any advantage
to the people at large for their domestic purposes.
But when the port opened, and British manufactures
became known, the low prices at which
they were sold at once occasioned a great and general
demand for them, and this has gone on yearly
increasing, till, amongst the country population especially,
the manufactures of Great Britain are become
articles of primary necessity. The gaucho is
everywhere clothed in them. Take his whole equipment&mdash;examine
everything about him&mdash;and what is
there not of raw hide that is not British? If his
wife has a gown, ten to one it is made at Manchester;
the camp-kettle in which he cooks his food,
the earthenware he eats from, the knife, his poncho,
spurs, bit, all are imported from England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>I am tempted here to go further, and to ask, who
enables him to purchase those articles? who buys
his master's hides, and enables that master to employ
and pay him? who but the foreign trader? Stop
the trade with foreign nations, and how long would
it be ere the gaucho would be reduced to the state
of the Indian of the pampas, fed on his beef and
horse-flesh, and clothed in the skins of wild beasts?
I put the question to those people in Buenos Ayres,
for there are still some such there, who continue to
look with jealousy on foreigners, and would fain have
the lower orders believe that the country has been
ruined since they were allowed freely to come
amongst them.</p>

<p>To return, however, to our subject. By far the
greatest part of the British imports into Buenos
Ayres consist of the plain and printed calicoes and
cloths, which, as I have just stated, are become of
the first necessity to the lower orders in this part of
South America: the cheaper we produce them, the
more they will take; and thus it is that every improvement
in our machinery at home, which lowers
the price of these manufactures, tends to contribute
(we hardly perhaps know how much) to the comforts
of the poorer classes in those remote countries.</p>

<p>In the sale of most of these articles no other
foreign country can compete with Great Britain,
from the low cost of their production; and as to any
native manufactures, it would be idle to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
them in a country as yet so scantily peopled, where
every hand is wanted, and may be turned to a tenfold
better account, in augmenting its natural resources
and means of production, as yet so imperfectly
developed.</p>

<p>Besides our cotton, linen, woollen, and silk manufactures,
we also send to Buenos Ayres considerable
quantities of ironmongery and cutlery, coarse and
fine earthenware, glass, foreign brandies and wines,
and a variety of other articles, the nature and value
of which, in detail, is fully exhibited in the general
return given in the Appendix of the principal
articles of British growth and manufacture which
have been exported from this country to the River
Plate in all the several years from 1830 to 1837
inclusive.</p>

<p>The total amount of the produce and manufactures
of the United Kingdom alone (exclusive of foreign
and colonial produce), exported direct from Great
Britain to the River Plate to the last sixteen years,

<p>To these amounts may be yearly added about
&pound;40,000 more for the value of foreign and colonial
produce sent direct from Great Britain.</p>

<p>This will give some idea of the general nature and
amount of our direct trade with the River Plate, and it
will be evident how mainly Great Britain contributes
to all the essential wants, as well as domestic comforts,
of the people of that part of the world.</p>

<p>The trade of <i>France</i> is different;&mdash;whilst we administer
to the real wants of the community, France
sends them articles rather of luxury than necessity,
such as superfine cloths and linens, merinos, cashmeres,
silks and cambrics, lace, gloves, shoes, silk
stockings, looking-glasses, fans, combs, jewellery,
and all sorts of made-up finery.</p>

<p>In 1822 it has been shown that the imports
into Buenos Ayres from France were calculated
to amount to 820,109 Spanish dollars, or about
164,022<i>l.</i> sterling. By official returns since pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>lished

<p>From <i>Germany</i> and <i>Holland</i> the imports, generally
speaking, are of a more substantial kind again.
German cloths and linens, and printed cottons from
the Rhine, were at one period introduced in considerable
quantities. A branch of the Rhenish Manufacturing
Company was set up in Buenos Ayres in
1824, for the sale particularly of the latter articles,
and the low prices at which, for a time, they were
sold threatened to interfere with the demand for
similar goods of British manufacture; it turned out,
however, that the prices in question did not remunerate
the company, and the establishment, not answering,
was broken up:&mdash;the German printed cottons
have been quite driven out of the field by British
goods of the same description.</p>

<p>From the <i>Netherlands</i> arms, especially swords
and pistols, are brought; and <i>Holland</i> sends gin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
butter and cheese, and Westphalia hams, for all
which there is a large demand amongst the natives.
This trade is chiefly from Antwerp, which is the
principal market for the sale of the Buenos Ayrean
hides on the continent.</p>

<p>The importations from the <i>Baltic</i> consist of iron,
cordage, canvas, pitch and tar, and deals.</p>

<p>The <i>Mediterranean</i> trade is principally in Sicilian
and Spanish produce, of which the most important
items are the cheap red wines of Sicily, the common
wines of Catalonia, brandies, olive oil, maccaroni,
and dried fruits, and used to be chiefly carried on
in British shipping, and through British houses at
Gibraltar:&mdash;latterly, however, a great part of these
importations have been in Sardinian vessels, from
twenty to thirty of which now visit Buenos Ayres
annually, instead of three or four, as was the case
ten years ago; in amount this trade is fully equal
to that from France, or from the north of Europe.
Had Spain at an earlier period recognised the independence
of the new states, she, instead of foreigners,
would undoubtedly have reaped the advantages of
this trade. Nor would this have been all: the habits
of the people, the customs they had been brought
up in, not to speak of international ties and connexions,&mdash;all
would have most forcibly tended to an
active commercial intercourse between her <i>ci-devant</i>
colonies and Spain, which would have been of vast
importance to the latter:&mdash;as it is, she has waited till
those habits, and customs, and ties have passed away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
and till a new race has grown up destitute of those
kindred feelings which naturally animated the last
generation, if not hostile to her from the disastrous
effects produced by her long and obstinate refusal to
recognise their political existence.</p>

<p>Spain must now take her chance in competing
with other nations, with the disadvantage of being
the last in the field. The cheapness, however, of
her wines will always ensure a large demand for
them, especially the common red wines of Catalonia.
There is also still some demand for Spanish serges,
and silks, and velvets, the sewing silks of Murcia,
and Spanish snuff; but, as most of these articles
can be imported from France of as good quality, and
at lower prices, the sale of them is very limited:&mdash;great
quantities of paper also were formerly introduced
from Spain, but it is now brought from other
countries, especially from Genoa, of a quality which
is preferred, and at lower prices. The annual importation
of Spanish and Sicilian wines is from
10,000 to 12,000 pipes, and about 1000 of brandy.</p>

<p>The trade with the <i>United States</i> was long a
very unnatural one, the principal article of import
from thence being flour, of which the average importations
for several years amounted to above
50,000 barrels.</p>

<p>It is not, perhaps, to be wondered at that the
larger profits of cattle-breeding should for a time
have superseded the pursuits of agriculture, but the
inconvenience and evils of an habitual dependence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
upon any foreign country, particularly upon one at
such a distance as North America, for the daily
bread of a whole population, became at last so manifest
that the legislature found itself called upon to
interpose to put an end to it, and to pass such enactments
as were necessary to foster and protect the
agricultural interests of the native proprietors. The
consequence has been that the province of Buenos
Ayres, which is capable of producing as good wheat
as any country in the world, has again commenced
growing not only a sufficiency for the consumption
of its own population, but for exportation; and in
the last two or three years both flour and corn have
been articles of shipment from the River Plate,
chiefly to Brazil.</p>

<p>If we except the flour, the principal articles of
import from the United States for several years were
the coarse unbleached cloths of their own manufacture,
called "domestics," of which, for a time, very
large quantities were sent to the Spanish-American
markets; indeed the very low prices at which these
goods were long sold brought them into great demand
in almost every part of the world where they
were admitted, although now, I believe, like the
printed goods from Germany, they can with difficulty
compete with similar manufactures made at Manchester.
Their other imports into Buenos Ayres
consist of spirits, soap, sperm candles, dried and
salted provisions, tobacco, furniture of an ordinary
though showy description, and deals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>From the returns laid before Congress it appears
that the amount of the direct trade between the
United States and the river Plate from 1829 to
1836 was as follows, calculated at the rate of five
dollars per pound sterling:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides their direct trade, the North Americans
have at times found a profitable employment for
their shipping in carrying Buenos Ayrean produce
(jerk beef) to the Havana, and in the coasting
trade between Brazil and the River Plate, though
the latter is now for the most part taken out of their
hands by the Brazilians themselves, who of late years
have become the carriers of their own produce.</p>

<p>This trade (with <i>Brazil</i>) has been even more disadvantageous
to Buenos Ayres than that with the
United States. The only article of native produce
to any amount which Brazil takes from the River
Plate is the jerk beef; whilst there is hardly an
article of Brazilian produce sent there which might
not be grown within the republic itself. The tobacco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
the sugars, the coffee, and the rice sent from thence,
might all be produced in any quantity in the northern
provinces of La Plata:&mdash;even the yerba-mat&eacute;, or
Paraguay tea, once so fruitful a source of profit to
the Vice-Royalty of Buenos Ayres, is now introduced
from the southern provinces of Brazil. It is
true that Paraguay Proper, where the greater part of
it was grown, has been closed for some years, but
there is no reason why it should not have been cultivated
in Corrientes or the Missions with just as
much success as in the Brazilian province of Rio
Grande:&mdash;as it is, owing to the inferior method of
preparing it, the Brazilian yerba-mat&eacute; is not equal
to that of Paraguay, and its use is, in consequence,
very much confined to the lower orders, whilst the
higher classes are imbibing a very general taste for
the teas of China as a substitute.</p>

<p>The imports from <i>China</i>, which appear in the
account quoted at page <a href="#Page_337">337</a>, consisted of assorted
cargoes of teas, silks, crapes, nankeens, wearing-apparel,
tortoise-shell for ladies' combs, earthenware,
matting, and a variety of minor articles, introduced
principally on British account, though under the
American flag, in consequence of our own restrictive
regulations not allowing at that time the employment
of British shipping in such a speculation.
Cargoes of a similar description have since occasionally
been introduced, but I believe it has been
found to answer better to import the articles into
Buenos Ayres as they may be wanted, either from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the United States, or from Rio de Janeiro, or from
England, than to freight ships expressly to introduce
cargoes direct from China. A certain quantity of
Chinese goods will always find a ready sale in the
Buenos Ayrean market.</p>

<p>The <i>Havana</i> trade has been an important one to
Buenos Ayres. Besides large shipments of mules
which are sent there, it takes off the greatest portion
of the jerk beef made in the country. It is used
there and in Brazil as an article of food for the slave
population; and the method of preparing it having
of late years been greatly improved, there is a constant
and increasing demand for it. If permitted to
be equally imported into the British West India colonies
it would probably find a large sale amongst
the same class of persons. I have been given to
understand that the best quality might be delivered
there under twopence a-pound, allowing for a moderate
duty:&mdash;its wholesomeness may be estimated
from the fact that, during the prevalence of the
cholera a few years back at the Havana, it was
observed there was a much less mortality among
the slaves fed upon jerk beef than on those plantations
where they were kept on other diet.</p>

<p>With respect to the trade with <i>Chile</i> and <i>Peru</i>, it
is of very trifling importance, and, whenever it has
been otherwise, has mainly consisted of re-exports
from Buenos Ayres of surplus stocks of European
goods, for the favourable sale of which there may
have been an occasional opening in the ports of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Pacific. There is no sale for Buenos Ayrean produce
on the western coast, since the stoppage of the
supply of yerba-mat&eacute;, of which, in old times, an immense
quantity was sent across the Andes to Chile
and Peru, and paid for in the precious metals.</p>

<p>From 1821 to 1826 the trade between Buenos
Ayres and foreign countries underwent little change,
but the breaking out of the war with Brazil then
interrupted it, and for nearly three years Buenos
Ayres was blockaded by the naval forces of the
Emperor, during which time the only foreign goods
imported were by such few vessels, chiefly North
American, as broke the blockade:&mdash;hardly was that
war concluded, when the troops returning from the
Banda Oriental, elated with their successes against
the Brazilians, revolted, overturned the government,
and threw the whole republic into confusion; in the
long struggle to put them down which ensued, the
country population, taking part, abandoned their
industrious pursuits, amongst the consequences of
which were a loss and destruction of property infinitely
greater and more ruinous to the nation than
all the waste and cost of the war with Brazil.
Public confidence was shaken to its foundation, and,
although it is true that, after a time, the constitutional
authorities were re-established, it was at an
enormous sacrifice of public and private wealth.</p>

<p>The commercial interests of the community were
greatly depressed by these events. When the blockade
of the river was raised at the close of 1828 there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
had been by no means such an influx of foreign goods
as might have been expected; and, when civil dissensions
shortly afterwards broke out, it was evident that
the mercantile houses in Buenos Ayres had suffered
too severely from the consequences of the war, and
the ruinous depreciation of the currency, to encourage
their correspondents in Europe to recommence
extensive speculations in a country which, to
all appearance, was destined to be sacrificed to the
passions of contending factions.</p>

<p>Whilst the republic was grievously suffering from
these evils, the results also of the newly constituted
independence of the Banda Oriental began to develop
themselves in a manner very detrimental to the
interests of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>So long as Monte Video was in the hands of the
Portuguese, its trade was extremely insignificant;
but no sooner was it freed from that yoke than the
people began to turn to account their local advantages,
and in a way which it soon became manifest
would greatly interfere with the trade of their old
metropolis. In proportion as the domestic embarrassments
of Buenos Ayres increased, and led that
government to raise its duties on foreign trade, so
the Monte Videans lowered theirs, and offered advantages
which were irresistible in the adjoining
provinces, where the duties levied by Buenos Ayres
on foreign goods had always been considered a
grievance, and where there was no national feeling
strong enough to induce the petty authorities to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
forego their own separate interests in order to aid in
sustaining the honour and credit of the capital.</p>

<p>Monte Video has in consequence become a sort
of entrep&ocirc;t for the supply of those provinces, as well
as of a portion of the neighbouring Brazilian population
in the Rio Grande; and to such an extent,
that the importations of foreign goods there were
valued at no less than 3,000,000 in 1835, and had
reached 3,500,000 hard dollars in 1836; whilst the
exports were nearly equal in amount, and now constitute
an important proportion of the returns in the
general account of the trade with the River Plate.</p>

<p>The amount of the imports into the port of Buenos
Ayres has been diminished in proportion. In 1837
they were barely equal to 7,000,000 hard dollars,
according to the official valuation, being a falling off
of nearly a third from what they were before the
war with Brazil.</p>

<p>Making allowances for this difference in its course,
the foreign trade with the River Plate has varied
little in its general amount for the last five years.</p>

<p>So far as regards the British trade, although there
may appear to be a diminution in the <i>value</i> of our
exports to the River Plate, as compared with what
they were in the years immediately preceding the
war between Buenos Ayres and Brazil, it will
nevertheless be found upon analysis that there has
been a large increase in the <i>quantity</i>, especially of
our most important manufactures, viz., the cottons,
the <i>quantity</i> of which now sent to the River Plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
is double what it was in 1825, though the total declared
<i>value</i> has only increased in the proportion of
from about 350,000<i>l.</i> to 400,000<i>l.</i>, the apparent discrepancy
being accounted for by the greatly reduced
rate at which we can now afford to sell these goods;
in the linens there is also an increase; in the
woollens there is, on the other hand, a slight falling
off; the silk goods sent out have varied very little in
value, but their amount was never of any importance.</p>

<p>The following is an account, taken from the
custom-house returns, of the average <i>quantities</i> of
these several descriptions of goods sent to the River
Plate in the four years from 1822 to 1825, inclusive,
compared with the last four years from 1834 to 1837,
inclusive:&mdash;</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the River Plate has been decidedly
the most important of all the markets which
have been opened to us for the sale of British
manufactures in Spanish America. It takes off a
much larger quantity of them than either Mexico,
Columbia, or Peru; and although it would appear
on the face of the official returns that of late years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
an equal or rather larger amount has been sent to
Chile, the truth is, that a considerable part of those
shipments were in reality destined for the southern
ports of Peru, and the west coast of Mexico.</p>

<p>A comparative account of our exports to all those
several countries during the last nine years will be
found with the other returns of trade in the Appendix,
and will show the relative and aggregate
amount of British produce and manufactures taken
by the new states during that period.</p>

<p>The average yearly value of them sent to the River
Plate in the last five years amounted to &pound;680,000.</p>


<h3>EXPORTS.</h3>

<p>The nature of the <i>export-trade</i> from Buenos Ayres
may be generally gathered from the following summary,
or comparative valuation of the exports from
thence in 1822, 1825, 1829, and 1837; though,
being taken from the Buenos Ayrean custom-house
accounts, some allowance must be made for short
manifests by the shippers, perhaps an addition of
twenty per cent. to the amount officially accounted
for in each year. The returns of specie and bullion
exported are especially liable to this observation.</p>

<p>This difference, which upon the whole was of little
importance, was at once accounted for by the investments
of foreign capital in the purchase of every
kind of property in the country previously to the war
with Brazil.</p>

<p>Although foreigners, as has been already observed,
were heavy sufferers by the events of that
war, the country was benefited in a way which
could hardly have been foreseen. In the impossibility
of making returns to Europe during the
continuance of the blockade, the greater part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
large amount of foreign property locked up in it was
laid out in cattle-farms, agricultural establishments,
saladeros (where the <i>jerk</i> beef is made), houses, and
a variety of speculations, the general tendency of
which was greatly to improve the real resources of
the country. Thus, although upon the whole there
was afterwards apparently a falling off in the foreign
trade of the port of Buenos Ayres compared with
what it was before the war, there was in reality an
increase in the quantities of the staple commodities
of the country brought to market.</p>

<p>This was encouraging, inasmuch as it is in proportion
to the increase and multiplication of the
native productions that we must look for the stability
and improvement of this trade&mdash;the great
difficulty being to collect returns for the importations
from foreign countries. Hides and skins have
been till lately the only articles of any importance
obtainable, though it is manifest that the country
is highly capable of producing a variety of other
articles of great value in a commercial point of
view.</p>

<p>Had the provincial governments been sufficiently
settled, and the state of the laws in the interior been
such as to have afforded any adequate security to
foreigners, intelligent men would doubtless long ago
have resorted to those parts, and would have given
a stimulus to the industry of the native population;
for it is to such persons the natives must look to
teach them to what account the productions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
soil and climate of the interior of South America
may be turned in other countries, as well as how
they should be prepared for those markets. Foreigners
would soon show them new sources of
wealth, and give value to those which have hitherto
been neglected or unknown. To them also the
natives must look for the introduction of machinery,
which may in some measure compensate for the
want of hands, which at present makes labour dear,
and deprives them of a hundred comforts and conveniences
in the commonest use in the civilised
countries of Europe. It would be folly to disguise
that these new countries are in the very infancy of
civilisation; studiously brought up by the mother-country
in entire ignorance of all that could teach
them their own value and importance, no wonder
they now have all to learn.</p>

<p>When I state that in many of the towns of the
interior a common wheelbarrow is as yet unheard
of, that in the capital itself the first pump ever seen
in a private house was put up a very few years ago
by an Englishman, it will easily be understood how
much the natives have yet to gain by the settlement
amongst them of the intelligent mechanics and
artificers of more civilised countries. Still greater
will be the importance to the community if foreign
capitalists should find sufficient encouragement and
protection to fix themselves in the country.</p>

<p>The province of Buenos Ayres, as contrasted with
the interior, has strikingly exhibited the fruits of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
more liberal policy towards foreigners; and could the
practical administration of the new laws keep pace
with their spirit, and with the general desire amongst
the people for improvement, the consequences would
be still more apparent. As it is, Buenos Ayres is
at least a century in advance of the provinces in
general knowledge and civilisation, and her wealth
and importance have increased in proportion.
Amongst other improvements which she owes to
foreigners, she is indebted to some enterprising
Englishmen for the introduction of late years of a
new source of wealth, which bids fair to rival in
importance the most valuable of her old staple
commodities.</p>

<p>It is but a few years ago that the wool of the
Buenos Ayrean sheep was hardly worth the expense
of cleaning it; and as to the meat, I doubt whether
the wild dogs would have touched it. It is well
known that their carcases, dried in the sun, were
used for fuel in the brick-kilns. The great pains
and persevering exertions, however, of some intelligent
foreigners to introduce and cultivate a better
breed has met with a success beyond all expectation,
and now promises to be of the greatest importance
to the future commercial prospects of the country.
The rapid increase in the value of this article of
production will be shown by the following comparative
account of the quantities which have been
imported into Great Britain alone in the last eight
years:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Harratt are the individuals
to whom Buenos Ayres is principally indebted for
this new source of wealth: the greater part of the
wool sent to England in 1834 was of their production,
and sold at Liverpool at very high prices
compared with those obtained for the old native
wools of the country, the quality of which comes
perhaps nearest to the low Scotch wools, and is only
suited for carpeting, and other strong descriptions of
goods. In a country where any quantity of land
applicable for the purpose may be had almost for
nothing, it is impossible to calculate to what extent
the breeding and improvement of sheep may be carried,
now that the wool is known to fetch a remunerating
price in foreign markets.</p>

<p>Nor is wool the only raw material for our manufactures
which we may expect to derive from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>Buenos Ayres. In my notices of the interior I
have stated that in Paraguay and some of the
Upper Provinces, especially Corrientes, cotton of a
quality equal to the average of that of Brazil is
produced:&mdash;this has been often satisfactorily shown
by samples sent to Liverpool. The natives cultivate
it and make cloths of it for their own domestic
purposes; and we shall probably obtain large quantities
of it whenever foreigners shall enjoy such
security as may induce them to carry into the interior
the machinery necessary to clean and pack it
for the markets of Europe.</p>

<p>From the same part of the Republic, as well as
from several of the Upper Provinces, any quantity
of indigo may be obtained, of an excellent quality.
M. Bonpland, the celebrated naturalist, who has
spent so many years in those parts, took the trouble
years ago to draw attention to the peculiarity of the
indigo found in the province of Corrientes. Speaking
of those parts called the Missions, he says, "The
whole of this country exceeds description; at every
step one meets with things both new and useful in
natural history. I have already collected 2000 plants,
a large quantity of seeds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Amongst the number of interesting plants to
which my attention has been called, I am of opinion
that this country may hereafter derive great advantages
from the three new species of indigo which I
have found in these fertile regions. They are very
different from the plant from which the indigo is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
obtained in Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and India;
and I flatter myself that the South Americans will
avail themselves of this discovery, and cultivate a
plant which has hitherto been disregarded under the
common name of <i>yuyo</i>. The superior quality of
indigo that may be obtained from this newly-discovered
plant, and the facility of its conveyance
down to a port of shipment, render it an object of
great importance to a country that has only a few
exports, and its cultivation, if encouraged by the
government, and undertaken by capitalists, will in
a few years furnish an interesting and staple commodity
for trade."</p>

<p>This account of the Corrientes indigo was copied
from the Buenos Ayrean papers into the Annual
Register for 1822, together with the following remarks
on some other of the natural resources of the
provinces of La Plata, which seem well deserving
the notice of those interested in the trade with that
part of the world:&mdash;"there are many other natural
resources of the country to which the attention
of the government of Buenos Ayres ought to
be called. The <i>seda silvestre</i>, a sort of wild silk
left in the woods by a certain caterpillar, is found
abundantly on the banks of the Paran&atilde;, and would
constitute a valuable export. Very good cochineal
may be gathered in Tucuman, besides a great quantity
of bees'-wax.</p>

<p>"The <i>rubia tinctoria</i> is found in many of the extensive
forests, but the best is in Tarija, the Chaco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
and the Sierra de Cordova; it yields a brilliant
colour. It was not till within these few years that
notice was taken of a new mode of dyeing a green
colour from a production called by the Spaniards
<i>clavillo</i>, from its resemblance to a little nail. Some
persons consider it to be the excrement of a certain
insect smaller than the cochineal; others believe it
to be the insect itself. Hitherto it has only been
gathered in Carquejia, and the point is found introduced
into the bark of a shrub; it was first used by
the poor people of the country, and it has since been
proved by repeated experiments that the Vicu&ntilde;a and
Alpaca wools, as well as cotton, after being prepared
with astringents, such as alum, and previously boiled
in a yellow dye, when thrown into a solution of
clavillo, acquire a beautiful green colour; the shade
of this simple is in itself greenish, and by keeping
grows darker: abundance of it is found in the valley
of Catamarca and province of Tucuman, but as yet
no scientific experiments have been made with it."</p>

<p>A variety of valuable gums and medicinal balsams
may be had from Paraguay, of the efficacy of which
marvellous stories are related by those who have resided
in those regions. The tree producing caoutchouc
is found in abundance about the rivers in
the upper part of that province, where the Indians
have long known its value, and use it as a substitute
for candles: the children make balls of it to
play with. They obtain it by making an incision
in the tree, from which the gum is run into a hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
placed beneath to catch it, and when cold is wound
upon large balls for use.</p>

<p>In addition to these, I may mention nitrate of
soda, so much used now in our cotton manufactories,
which may be procured in any quantity from the
provinces of La Plata;&mdash;as yet, I believe, not a
single bag of it has ever been brought from Buenos
Ayres, although there is no reason why it should
not be imported from thence at as low a cost as from
Chile and Peru; from which countries alone, of late
years, the annual importations have been from 50,000
to 100,000 cwt.</p>

<p>War in Europe will always create an increased
demand for the produce of such a country as Buenos
Ayres. In the last years of the general war, not
only was there an enormous demand for the hides of
Buenos Ayres, but considerable quantities of tallow
also were shipped from thence; and, although those
shipments ceased to answer when the Russian markets
were reopened, they may always be calculated
upon again should any stoppage take place of our
ordinary supplies through the Baltic. At present,
though Buenos Ayrean tallow is worth as much as
Russian in the English markets, there is no great
quantity of it produced, in consequence of the animals
being killed for their hides as soon as they are marketable,
which is before they yield tallow in any
quantity worth collecting.</p>

<p>Corn also was an article of export from Buenos
Ayres during the general war in Europe, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
again beginning to be exported to Brazil&mdash;as is
shown by the account of the exports in 1837.
It is of an excellent quality, and might be grown
to any extent.</p>

<p>Mules, horses, and asses have at times been
shipped in large numbers for the West Indies and
for the Isle of France, and have been sold there at
an enormous profit.</p>

<p>In the short notices given of the provinces of the
interior, I have given such accounts of any other of
their native productions as I could collect. The
silver and gold mines of Cordova, La Rioja, Mendoza,
San Juan, and Salta, may eventually become
productive; and, when an intercourse is once more
permitted with Bolivia through the interior, it may
be expected that some portion of the precious metals
produced there also will, as formerly, find their way
to Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>In old times, not only were the rich and populous
provinces of Bolivia exclusively supplied through the
Rio de la Plata with all such articles as they wanted
from Europe, but they took from the lower provinces
a variety of useful productions of their own, for all
which they paid in gold and silver. Of mules alone
upwards of 60,000 were annually sent to Potosi
from the provinces of Tucuman and Santa F&eacute;.</p>

<p>This internal trade, once of so much importance
to the people of the intermediate provinces, was
annihilated in the struggle for establishing the
independency of the Republic; for, Bolivia remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>ing
to the last in the hands of the Spaniards,
of course all commercial intercourse was prohibited
with the provinces of La Plata, which had thrown
off the yoke of the mother-country. To this may
be ascribed in great measure the extreme poverty
and backwardness of many of those provinces at
the present day. Salta, Tucuman, Cordova, Santa
F&eacute;, and Paraguay, lost the best markets for their
native produce; whilst the people, dragged from
their pastoral and agricultural pursuits in the first
instance to fight against their old masters, and
afterwards to destroy one another in support of the
ephemeral authorities which succeeded them, naturally
contracted such unsettled and disorderly habits
as it will require many a year of domestic peace and
better government to wean them from. To time,
and a continuance of those blessings, as I have elsewhere
said, we must, I believe, look for the remedy
of these evils, and for any material improvement in
the condition of the interior provinces of the republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>


<h3>HORSES AND CATTLE.</h3>

<p>In connexion with what I have said upon the
trade of Buenos Ayres, a brief notice of the origin
and extraordinary increase of the vast herds of horses
and cattle which at present constitute so large a portion
of the riches of Buenos Ayres, may perhaps be
not uninteresting to some of my readers.</p>

<p>America is indebted to Europe for these animals,
which were unknown to the people of the New
World before its discovery by the Spaniards. Of
the two it will easily be understood that the horses,
which formed so important a feature in the military
equipment of the conquerors, were the first introduced.
In 1535, the Adelantado Mendoza, who
was the first to effect a landing at Buenos Ayres,
took seventy with him on board the expedition which
accompanied him from Spain, of which perhaps half
were lost on the voyage, if we may judge from the
small number of cavalry&mdash;one author says twelve,
another thirty&mdash;which he was able to muster in his
first battle with the Indians. The few that survived,
when his followers were shortly afterwards driven
out of that part of the country by the warlike natives,
were turned loose into the pampas, where they multiplied
exceedingly, and were found in great numbers
forty years afterwards by De Garay, when he
re-established the Spanish settlement at Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in that expedition (in 1580) that De Garay
carried from Paraguay the first horned cattle ever
seen in the pampas. How the stock had previously
reached Paraguay is thus told by Dean Funes, the
native historian. He says, "In 1555 there arrived
at Assumption, from San Francisco, on the coast of
Brazil, a few straggling emigrants, amongst whom
were two Portuguese gentlemen, brothers, of the
name of Goa, having with them a bull and eight
cows, the origin of that mighty stock of cattle which
now forms the wonder of the provinces of La Plata."
The Portuguese servant intrusted with the important
charge of these animals in their long over-land
journey from the coast, whose name was Gaete, was
rewarded for his care of them with one of the cows,
a payment thought so much of at the time, that it
gave rise to a saying still in use in those parts&mdash;"Es
mas caro que las vacas de Gaete" ("Dearer than
Gaete's cows").</p>

<p>But the value then set upon all European animals
carried to America was enormous, as well it might
be when the difficulties are considered of safely
transporting them in the crazy and inconvenient
shipping of those days. In Peru, in the same year
(1555), so highly were horses prized, that it was
thought worth recording in the public archives of
Cuzco that 10,000 dollars had been refused for one
offered for sale;&mdash;in that city a boar and sow, about
the same time, were sold for 1600 dollars, and European
sheep and goats fetched prices nearly as high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the cattle carried by De Garay to Buenos
Ayres it was not long before some escaped into the
territory of the Indians, where they increased and
multiplied, as the horses had done before. The
settlers were too few, in the first instance, to domesticate
more than were necessary for their own
immediate wants, neither was the extent of their
lands, for some time, adequate to the maintenance of
any considerable stock; the cattle, therefore, ranged
at liberty in the Pampas, and, though occasionally
hunted down by the Spaniards for the hides, or by
the Indians for food, the destruction was as nothing
compared with the prodigious increase which went
on:&mdash;they also found their way into the Banda
Oriental, probably from Paraguay, where they multiplied
even faster than in the Pampas, from the
better quality of the pasturage and the more constant
supply of water; and here it was that the illicit
trade established by the Portuguese appears first to
have awakened the Spaniards to a notion of the
future importance of these animals.</p>

<p>The vicinity of their establishment at Colonia,
immediately opposite to Buenos Ayres, not only
facilitated their smuggling across it the European
goods and tobacco and slaves which were wanted,
but made it a convenient station for collecting from
the Spaniards the hides for which they were but too
glad to find any sale under the restrictions then imposed
upon all trade. The Portuguese took good
care to buy them only at such low prices as insured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
them an enormous profit upon their exportation for
other markets; but the speculation answered to both
parties, and as the contraband trade of the Portuguese
with Buenos Ayres increased, so we find did
the cattle establishments of the Spaniards in the
Banda Oriental.</p>

<p>Cargoes of hides were occasionally shipped for
Spain, particularly after the Spaniards founded
Monte Video, in 1726; but the demand was far
from equal to the production, and the stock of cattle
went on gradually increasing till the partial opening
of the colonial trade in 1778. At that period the
cattle had reached an amount which, perhaps, has
never been equalled at any subsequent period, but
the increased demand for country produce which
then took place was well nigh exterminating the
whole stock. In 1783 no less than 1,400,000 hides
were officially registered for exportation, besides a
vast number clandestinely shipped.</p>

<p>Superabundance also led to waste to an enormous
extent; a gaucho would kill an ox for the tongue,
or any other part of the animal he might fancy for
his dinner, and leave the rest of the carcase to be
devoured by the vultures, or by the wild dogs which
swarmed in the country, and destroyed an incredible
number of the young cattle. Little respect
was then paid to this description of property, and
the peons were easily bribed to kill their masters'
or their neighbours' cattle to barter their hides for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
tobacco and spirits offered to them by the peddling
traders who wandered over the country to collect
them.</p>

<p>The government was obliged, at last, to take
strong measures to stop these evils:&mdash;they enacted
heavy penalties on those found destroying or selling
what did not of right belong to them; whilst, for
the better identification of property, every proprietor
was obliged, by a given day, to brand his cattle with
his own particular mark:&mdash;all beasts found without
a mark after that time were declared to be the
king's, and the right to seek for and seize them
was sold to or farmed by individuals. Proprietors
were obliged to take out licenses to sell their hides,
and the slaughter of cows and calves was entirely
prohibited. War, also, to extermination, was declared
against the wild dogs.</p>

<p>These regulations, however feebly enforced, were
not without effect:&mdash;the protection, at any rate,
which they promised to property was enough to induce
the people to extend their cattle establishments,
whilst their own experience, after a time, led them
to regulate their annual sales in more due proportion
to their stocks.</p>

<p>The annual increase on a well-regulated estancia
has been ascertained to be from 30 to 40 per cent.,
which yields an enormous profit to the proprietor,
whilst his expenses are comparatively trifling.
The only serious casualty to which the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>cattle-owner
is liable is from the effects of occasional
droughts, which in these countries are, at times,
attended with frightful devastation:&mdash;the cattle then
rush in thousands from their own pastures in search
of water in every direction, and perish for want of it
in immense numbers. In the last great drought,
which continued during the summers of 1830, 31,
and 32, it was calculated that from a million and a
half to two millions of animals died:&mdash;the borders of
all the lakes and streamlets in the province were
long afterwards white with their bones<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. But for
this calamity the quantity of hides brought forward
in the last five years would have been much greater
than it has been.</p>

<p>In the years immediately preceding the independency
of the republic the annual export of hides
from the river Plate was from 700,000 to 800,000,
besides an enormous consumption of them for every
conceivable purpose by all classes of the people of
the country, and great destruction by waste; so that
it is generally supposed that at that time the number
of cattle in the provinces was not less than five mil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>lions.
Azara estimated them at <i>twelve</i> millions (in
1792), but I never met with any one who would
agree with him in that calculation.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of these animals were then
reared in the Banda Oriental and Entre Rios:&mdash;nor
was it till subsequently to the commencement of
the struggle for their independence, when those provinces
became the seat of war, and were laid waste
by the Portuguese and by Artigas, that the people
of Buenos Ayres began to occupy the lands south of
the River Salado, which have given so much increased
importance to that province. Since that period
every encouragement and protection which it is possible
to give to this source of national wealth has
been wisely afforded by the ruling authorities.</p>

<p>The Pampas are no longer a vast, useless, and
unappropriated waste in which the animals run wild
as formerly; by far the greater part of the lands
comprised within the boundary line laid down in the
map having been carefully measured by the government
officers, and allotted to individuals, who, as
they occupy them, are obliged to set up and preserve
their marks of possession, which, together with the
bounds and extent of every separate estancia, are
duly registered in the topographical department of
the state. Of the hundreds of thousands of cattle
now reared in these lands there is hardly, perhaps, a
single animal of a year old which is not branded
with the mark of an owner, and that mark is equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>

claim his property wherever he may find it.</p>

<p>It is calculated by the best authorities,&mdash;the most
extensive proprietors in the province,&mdash;that the present
stock of cattle in the territory of Buenos Ayres
alone may be from three to four millions; and it is
supposed there may be above another million in the
other provinces:&mdash;from this we ought to calculate
upon an annual exportation of nearly a million of
hides, gradually increasing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

PUBLIC DEBT.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Origin of the Funded Debt of Buenos Ayres. Receipts and Expenditure
from 1822 to 1825, during peace. Loan raised in England.
War with Brazil, and stoppage of all revenue from the Customhouse
for three years. Pecuniary difficulties in consequence.
The Provincial Bank of Buenos Ayres converted into a National
one. The Government interferes with it, and, by forcing it to
increase its issues, destroys its credit. Debt at the close of the
war at the end of 1828. Hopes founded on the peace destroyed
by the mutiny of the Army;&mdash;deplorable consequences of that
event. Depreciation of the Currency. Deficit in the revenue,
and increase of the Funded Debt:&mdash;its amount in 1834, and
further increase in 1837. General account of the liabilities of the
Government up to that year; increased by subsequent war with
Bolivia, and French Blockade.</p></div>


<p>In any attempt to convey an idea of the finance
accounts of Buenos Ayres it should, in the first instance,
be observed that, although those accounts
are, <i>prim&aacute; facie, national</i>, they exhibit in reality the
receipts and expenditure of the government of the
<i>province</i> of Buenos Ayres alone:&mdash;the other provinces,
containing three-fourths of the population of
the whole republic, contribute nothing towards the
general expenses, though most of them manage to support
their petty provincial administrations. Buenos
Ayres alone found all the pecuniary means both for
the war with Spain for the establishment of the inde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>pendence
of the republic, and, subsequently, for liberating
the Banda Oriental from the domination of the
Emperor of Brazil, which latter state, though gaining
everything by the result, has never repaid her a
single dollar. Chile owes her as much for the
armies sent across the Andes, which freed that
country also from the yoke of the King of Spain,
and has been equally ungrateful.</p>

<p>It is only astonishing how this little State contrived,
as she did, to raise the ways and means for
these efforts, and that she did not altogether succumb
to the difficulties and embarrassments they
gave rise to:&mdash;that they have left her finances in a
wretched state can hardly be wondered at. Nevertheless,
if it had not been for the struggle with
Brazil, which succeeded the establishment of her
own independence of the mother-country, Buenos
Ayres would long ago have been quit with all her
creditors, presenting a very different appearance,
quoad her finances, to the world.</p>

<p>When the struggle with Spain was over, and her
military establishments reduced, the arrangement of
her pecuniary affairs became one of the first objects
of her provincial administration.</p>

<p>In 1821 commissioners were appointed to call in
and liquidate all outstanding claims against the government,
of whatever description, not excepting
even those left unsettled by the authorities of the
mother-country previous to the declaration of independence.
The greater part of these debts were due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
for actual services, or for loans to the government in
times of necessity; others were of a more doubtful
character, and had been sold or made over to other
parties by the original creditors, and into these classes
they were separated by the legislature:&mdash;the one
receiving obligations bearing an interest of six per
cent; the other, receiving the same, bearing an interest
of four per cent per annum; and these obligations
were simultaneously provided for by the
creation of public stocks, bearing quarterly interest:&mdash;the
first instance of the establishment of anything
like a public funded debt in any of the new states of
South America. Commissioners were appointed to
manage it, and to pay the dividends quarterly to the
stock-holders; transfer-books were opened, and a
sinking-fund was established for its gradual redemption.
The first quarter's interest became due on the
1st of January, 1822, and, for the credit of Buenos
Ayres, it should be stated that, notwithstanding the
great subsequent increase of the debt, under the circumstances
to which I shall presently refer, the quarterly
dividends have, from that time to this, been as
regularly paid as those at the Bank of England.</p>

<p>The amount of stock created up to the close of
1825 was&mdash;</p>

<p>Never had the financial concerns of the republic
borne so creditable and promising an appearance.
In this prosperity nothing was thought of but
schemes for improvement of every kind; and projects
were submitted to the government for a variety
of public works, piers, docks, custom-houses, &amp;c.,
some of which were of manifest utility.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances, and with a view
to carry into effect some of the projected improvements,
that the government of Buenos Ayres determined
to endeavour to raise a loan in England, which
there was no difficulty in obtaining upon the terms
they stipulated for, viz., seventy per cent. At that
price parties in London contracted with them for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
loan, nominally, of a million sterling, to be raised
upon bonds bearing interest at six per cent per
annum, payable half-yearly. A sinking-fund of
&pound;5000 per annum was to be applied to their redemption,
and the contractors were further allowed
to keep back the amount of the dividends for the
first two years. This, with charges, &amp;c., reduced
the sum to be paid over to the government of Buenos
Ayres to about &pound;600,000. The first half-yearly
dividend became due on the third or fourth quarter
of 1824.</p>

<p>Whilst the government were deliberating, amongst
the many projects before them, how to lay out this
money to the best advantage, the quarrel broke out
with the Emperor of Brazil for the possession of the
Banda Oriental, which soon settled all difficulty on
that point, and absorbed every dollar of the loan in
preparations for the ruinous war which followed.
From the commencement of that struggle not only
were the expenses of the state enormously increased,
but, when resources were most wanted, nearly the
whole of its ordinary revenues (depending upon the
duties on foreign trade) were suddenly cut off by the
blockade of the river Plate instituted by the Brazilians,
which lasted during the whole continuance
of the war, viz., from December, 1825, to September,
1828,&mdash;nearly three years.</p>

<p>In their emergencies the government determined
to avail themselves of the bank, an establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
which had been set up by the leading capitalists of
Buenos Ayres in 1822, upon the grant of an exclusive
privilege of issuing notes <i>in that province</i> for
twenty years. It was entirely independent of the
government, and was managed by directors annually
chosen by the shareholders. To the mercantile body
it was of great utility, and its notes, payable in specie
on demand, in default of any national coinage, had
become the ordinary currency of Buenos Ayres, and
were as readily taken as gold or silver:&mdash;its capital
was a million of dollars. But, as this could not be
done compatibly with its independence and existing
constitution, it was further, in an evil hour, resolved
to alter entirely its original character.</p>

<p>Under pretence of extending the circulation of its
notes throughout the republic, application was made
to the General Congress<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> to sanction its conversion
into a <i>national</i> bank, with a nominal capital of <i>ten
millions</i> of dollars, towards which the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
subscribed for shares to the amount of <i>three millions</i>,
and very soon assumed the right to exact from it
almost any accommodation they required. The consequences
were soon apparent. The wants of the
government increasing, the bank was obliged, in
order to provide for them, to increase its issues, which,
ere long, reached an amount obviously out of all proportion
to its real capital<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. The aid of the legislature
was again called in:&mdash;the notes were declared
a legal tender for their nominal value, and the bank
was relieved by law from the obligation of paying
them in specie on demand:&mdash;its credit fell to the
lowest ebb, and its notes became proportionably
depreciated.</p>

<p>The government, however, had then no alternative
but to go on with the system it had commenced:&mdash;the
precious metals having wholly disappeared as a
medium of circulation, it was in this depreciated
currency that it found itself obliged to continue borrowing
such sums as it required, until, as may easily
be imagined, the nominal amount of the public debt
became fearfully increased. Before the close of the
war with Brazil, the value of the paper dollar of
the bank had fallen from 45<i>d.</i> to below 12<i>d.</i> sterling;
and at the end of 1828, besides 6,000,000
dollars which had been added to the amount of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
funded debt, the deficit on the general account of
receipts and expenditure was 13,412,075 dollars,
the whole of which was due to the bank; and this
was independently of the English loan.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when peace was signed, upon terms
highly honourable to the republic, the public confidence
immediately rallied. The value of the current
dollar rose at once to 24<i>d.</i>, and amidst the
general rejoicings even the pecuniary prospects of
the country put on a flattering appearance. Nor
were the hopes entertained by the Buenos Ayreans
of a speedy improvement in their finances without
foundation. It was evident, as has been observed
in the preceding chapter, that, although the foreign
war had led to enormous expenses, the sudden
suspension of the trade had locked up a large amount
of foreign, as well as native, capital within the country,
the investment of which, in a variety of ways,
had greatly tended to increase its means of production,
and consequently its national resources.</p>

<p>The mutiny of the army, however, under General
Lavalle, and his barbarous murder of General Dorrego,
the Governor, blasted all these flattering prospects,
and involved the whole republic in confusion
and ruin. The consequences of the civil warfare which
followed to the finances of the country were deplorable,
and infinitely worse than those occasioned by
the war with Brazil. The currency suffered apparently
beyond all hope of recovery, and the paper
dollar, after great fluctuations, fell to about 7<i>d.</i>, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
which rate it has, with little variation, been stationary
for the last seven years.</p>

<p>In the five years from 1828 to 1832, inclusive,
the receipts and expenses were as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>War Department</i>, it will be seen, absorbed
more than three-fourths of the whole revenue:&mdash;nor
was this the final account of the extraordinary expenses
which may be traced to the revolt of the
troops above alluded to. Whilst they were cutting
the throats of their countrymen in the interior, the
Indians broke in upon the frontiers, left without defence,
and made it necessary to organise a new army
to put them down, which occasioned a great expendi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>ture,
though it was, perhaps, compensated for by
the extension of the frontiers, and the new security
it gave to the lands in the south of the province.</p>

<p>To provide for these expenses the Funded Debt was
again very largely increased, and at the close of 1835
stood as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides this there was a floating debt in treasury-bills
and other outstanding claims of nearly
8,000,000 more to be provided for out of the ways
and means for 1836, which, after every possible
reduction of the establishments, were hardly equal
to meet the ordinary expenditure. In the hope of
being enabled to pay off this part of the debt, the
Legislature authorised the Government, in the first
instance, to offer for sale, at a fixed price, a portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
of the lands in the south, acquired in the recent
campaigns against the Indians:&mdash;but their expectations
were not realised,&mdash;there were no bidders
for the lands; and when the junta met the next
year to receive the accounts for 1837, instead of
any decrease in the floating debt, it had risen to
above 9,000,000 of dollars. They then adopted the
alternative of creating Public Funds, and passed a
law for adding no less than 17,000,000 to the Public
Debt. The funds in question were placed at the
disposal of the government for sale, at a price not
lower than sixty per cent, at which it was calculated
that they would produce 10,200,000, and be, therefore,
sufficient to cover the floating debt, and leave
the ordinary revenue free to meet the ordinary expenditure
of the states. To provide for the increased
interest of the Public Debt, new stamp
duties and a more strict enforcement of the direct
taxation (Contribucion Directa) were enacted.</p>

including this new creation of stock, the responsibilities

fund of this part of the debt amounted to 3,055,199
current dollars.</p>

<p>Secondly.&mdash;The English loan for 1,000,000 sterling,
the interest of which (at the rate of &pound;60,000
per annum) has been unpaid since January, 1828.</p>

<p>And Thirdly,&mdash;The amount of the bank issues in
circulation, understood to be about 20,000,000 of
dollars currency, for the whole amount of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
the government had declared itself responsible to the
public as the easiest mode of settling its own account
with that establishment upon the expiration of its
charter in 1836.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the whole of the ordinary
revenues were only estimated at 12,000,000 of
currency, of which about a fourth part, as above
stated, was required to be set apart in the first
instance to meet the charges for the funded debt.</p>

<p>The remaining 9,000,000 was insufficient by half
to meet the ordinary expenditure of the state, much
less to enable the government to make any provision
for a settlement with the English bondholders, or for
the redemption of the currency.</p>

<p>This was the state of things at the commencement
of 1837, as far as I can collect from the accounts
which have been published; deplorable as it appeared,
it perhaps would not have been altogether
irremediable, had the peace of the country been
preserved, and the war establishments been reduced.</p>

<p>The estimated revenue of 12,000,000 was based
upon the average of the years immediately preceding,
which had been far from favourable to the development
of the resources of the republic. It was
notorious that many branches of it were very loosely
collected; the contribucion directa, or property-tax,
especially, which produced little or nothing,
instead of being made, as it ought to have been,
one of the most important items in the revenue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
of the state. In this, as in other branches of it,
there was no doubt that, with care and good management,
the public income might have been greatly
increased. Besides, there were still the greater part
of the public lands undisposed of, which the legislature,
in 1836, had given authority to the government
to sell, for the purpose of liquidating the debt previously
contracted; and with regard to the funded
debt, the operation of the sinking fund with its
accumulating interest was becoming so efficient that,
notwithstanding its large amount, a very few years
indeed would suffice to redeem the whole of it, if not
further increased. In 1837 the sinking fund already
amounted to more than a million of dollars,
which, in twelve months, redeemed little short of
two millions and a half of stock.</p>

<p>But, as I have before had occasion to observe,
touching their social condition, so it is most especially
with regard to their financial prospects, there
can be no well-founded expectation of any improvement
which is not based upon a continuation of the
peace and quiet of the country. That, unfortunately,
has been again interrupted in the past year, and the
Republic has not only become involved in the war
declared by Chile against Bolivia, but in a much
more serious and disastrous dispute with the French,
the calamitous consequences of which it is difficult
to estimate.</p>

<p>Pending the settlement of their alleged grievances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
the French have instituted a strict blockade of Buenos
Ayres, which falls heavily upon those neutral
parties who have established an extensive commercial
intercourse with the country.</p>

<h3>No. 1.<br />

<span class="smcap">Declaration of Independence of the United
Provinces of South America in 1816.</span></h3>

<p>We, the Representatives of the United Provinces of South
America, in General Congress assembled, invoking that
Supreme Being who presides over the universe, in the name
and by the authority of the people we represent, and protesting
before Heaven and all nations and inhabitants of
the earth, the justice of this our resolution, do hereby
solemnly declare that it is the unanimous and undoubted
determination of these provinces to break the bonds which
have bound them to the kings of Spain, to recover the
rights of which they have been deprived, and to take
upon themselves the high character of a free nation
independent of king Ferdinand VII. and his successors,
and of Spain; with full and ample power in consequence
<i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> to establish for themselves such form
of government as the pressure of existing circumstances may
render imperative.</p>

<p>All and every one of them do publish and declare the
same, and pledge themselves, through us, to carry into
effect and to maintain this their fixed resolve with their
lives, their fortunes, and their fame.</p>

<p>Wherefore be this duly published for the knowledge
of all whom it may concern; and considering what may be
due to other nations in this matter, a separate manifesto
shall set forth in detail the grave and weighty reasons which
have led to this our solemn declaration.</p>

<p>Given in the hall of our meetings, signed by our hands,
sealed with the seal of the Congress, and countersigned by
the secretaries thereof, in the city of San Miguel de Tucuman,
the 9th day of July, 1816.</p>

<h3>No. 4.<br />

<span class="smcap">Treaty between Great Britain and the United Provinces
of Rio de la Plata.</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>Signed at Buenos Ayes, February 2, 1825.</i></p>

<p>Extensive commercial intercourse having been established
for a series of years between the dominions of His Britannic
Majesty, and the territories of the United Provinces of Rio
de la Plata, it seems good for the security as well as encouragement
of such commercial intercourse, and for the
maintenance of good understanding between His said Britannic
Majesty and the said United Provinces, that the relations
now subsisting between them should be regularly acknowledged
and confirmed by the signature of a treaty of amity,
commerce, and navigation.</p>

<p>For this purpose they have named their respective plenipotentiaries,
that is to say;&mdash;</p>

<p>His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, Woodbine Parish, Esquire, His said
Majesty's Consul-General in the Province of Buenos Ayres
and its Dependencies;&mdash;and the United Provinces of Rio
de la Plata, Se&ntilde;or Don Manuel Jos&eacute; Garcia, Minister Secretary
for the Departments of Government, Finance, and
Foreign Affairs, of the National Executive Power of the said
Provinces;</p>

<p>Who, after having communicated to each other their
respective Full Powers, found to be in due and proper form,
have agreed upon and concluded the following Articles:&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article I.</span></h4>

<p>There shall be perpetual amity between the dominions
and subjects of His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland, and the United Provinces
of Rio de la Plata, and their inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article II.</span></h4>

<p>There shall be, between all the territories of His Britannic
Majesty in Europe, and the territories of the United
Provinces of Rio de la Plata, a reciprocal freedom of Commerce:
the inhabitants of the two countries, respectively,
shall have liberty freely and securely to come, with their
ships and cargoes, to all such places, ports, and rivers, in
the territories aforesaid, to which other foreigners are or may
be permitted to come, to enter into the same, and to remain
and reside in any part of the said territories respectively;
also to hire and occupy houses and warehouses for the purposes
of their commerce; and, generally, the merchants
and traders of each nation, respectively, shall enjoy the most
complete protection and security for their commerce; subject
always to the laws and statutes of the two countries
respectively.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article III.</span></h4>

<p>His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland engages further, that in all his dominions
situated out of Europe, the inhabitants of the United
Provinces of Rio de la Plata shall have the like liberty of
commerce and navigation stipulated for in the preceding
article, to the full extent in which the same is permitted at
present, or shall be permitted hereafter, to any other nation.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article IV.</span></h4>

<p>No higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation
into the territories of His Britannic Majesty, of
any articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of the
United Provinces of Rio de la Plata, and no higher or other
duties shall be imposed on the importation into the said
United Provinces, of any articles of the growth, produce, or
manufacture of His Britannic Majesty's dominions, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
are or shall be payable on the like articles, being the
growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign
country; nor shall any other or higher duties or charges be
imposed, in the territories or dominions of either of the
contracting parties, on the exportation of any articles to the
territories or dominions of the other, than such as are or
may be payable on the exportation of the like articles to any
other foreign country: nor shall any prohibition be imposed
upon the exportation or importation of any articles the
growth, produce, or manufacture of His Britannic Majesty's
dominions, or of the said United Provinces, which shall not
equally extend to all other nations.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article V.</span></h4>

<p>No higher or other duties or charges on account of tonnage,
light, or harbour dues, pilotage, salvage in case of
damage or shipwreck, or any other local charges, shall be
imposed, in any of the ports of the said United Provinces,
on British vessels of the burthen of above one hundred and
twenty tons, than those payable, in the same ports, by vessels
of the said United Provinces of the same burthen; nor
in the ports of any of His Britannic Majesty's territories,
on the vessels of the United Provinces of above one hundred
and twenty tons, than shall be payable, in the same ports,
on British vessels of the same burthen.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Article VI.</span></h4>

<p>The same duties shall be paid on the importation into the
said United Provinces of any article the growth, produce, or
manufacture of His Britannic Majesty's dominions, whether
such importation shall be in vessels of the said United Provinces,
or in British vessels; and the same duties shall be
paid on the importation into the dominions of His Britannic
Majesty of any article the growth, produce, or manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
of the said United Provinces, whether such importation
shall be in British vessels, or in vessels of the said United
Provinces;&mdash;The same duties shall be paid, and the same
drawbacks and bounties allowed, on the exportation of any
articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of His Britannic
Majesty's dominions to the said United Provinces,
whether such exportation shall be in vessels of the said
United Provinces, or in British vessels; and the same duties
shall be paid, and the same bounties and drawbacks allowed,
on the exportation of any articles the growth, produce, or
manufacture of the said United Provinces to His Britannic
Majesty's dominions, whether such exportation shall be in
British vessels, or in vessels of the said United Provinces.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article VII.</span></h4>

<p>In order to avoid any misunderstanding with respect to
the regulations which may respectively constitute a British
vessel, or a vessel of the said United Provinces, it is hereby
agreed, that all vessels built in the dominions of His Britannic
Majesty, and owned, navigated, and registered according
to the laws of Great Britain, shall be considered as
British vessels; and that all vessels built in the territories
of the said United Provinces, properly registered, and owned
by the citizens thereof, or any of them, and whereof the
master and three-fourths of the mariners, at least, are citizens
of the said United Provinces, shall be considered as
vessels of the said United Provinces.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article VIII.</span></h4>

<p>All merchants, commanders of ships, and others, the subjects
of His Britannic Majesty, shall have the same liberty,
in all the territories of the said United Provinces, as the
natives thereof, to manage their own affairs themselves, or
to commit them to the management of whomsoever they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
please, as broker, factor, agent, or interpreter; nor shall
they be obliged to employ any other persons for those purposes,
nor to pay them any salary or remuneration, unless
they shall choose to employ them; and absolute freedom
shall be allowed, in all cases, to the buyer and seller to bargain
and fix the price of any goods, wares, or merchandise
imported into, or exported from, the said United Provinces,
as they shall see good.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article IX.</span></h4>

<p>In whatever relates to the lading and unlading of ships,
the safety of merchandise, goods, and effects, the disposal
of property of every sort and denomination, by sale, donation
or exchange, or in any other manner whatsoever, as also
the administration of justice, the subjects and citizens of the
two contracting parties shall enjoy, in their respective dominions,
the same privileges, liberties, and rights, as the
most favoured nation, and shall not be charged, in any of
these respects, with any higher duties or imposts than those
which are paid, or may be paid, by the native subjects or
citizens of the power in whose dominions they may be resident.
They shall be exempted from all compulsory military
service whatsoever, whether by sea or land, and from all
forced loans, or military exactions or requisitions; neither
shall they be compelled to pay any ordinary taxes, under
any pretext whatsoever, greater than those that are paid by
native subjects or citizens.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article X.</span></h4>

<p>It shall be free for each of the two contracting parties to
appoint consuls for the protection of trade, to reside in the
dominions and territories of the other party; but before any
consul shall act as such, he shall, in the usual form, be approved
and admitted by the government to which he is sent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
and either of the contracting parties may except from the
residence of consuls such particular places as either of them
may judge fit to be so excepted.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XI.</span></h4>

<p>For the better security of commerce between the subjects
of His Britannic Majesty, and the inhabitants of the United
Provinces of Rio de La Plata, it is agreed, that if at any
time any interruption of friendly commercial intercourse, or
any rupture should unfortunately take place between the
two contracting parties, the subjects or citizens of either of
the two contracting parties residing in the dominions of the
other, shall have the privilege of remaining and continuing
their trade therein, without any manner of interruption, so
long as they behave peaceably, and commit no offence
against the laws; and their effects and property, whether
entrusted to individuals or to the state, shall not be liable to
seizure or sequestration, or to any other demands than those
which may be made upon the like effects or property, belonging
to the native inhabitants of the state in which such
subjects or citizens may reside.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XII.</span></h4>

<p>The subjects of His Britannic Majesty residing in the
United Provinces of Rio de la Plata, shall not be disturbed,
persecuted, or annoyed on account of their religion, but they
shall have perfect liberty of conscience therein, and to celebrate
divine service either within their own private houses,
or in their own particular churches or chapels, which they
shall be at liberty to build and maintain in convenient places,
approved of by the government of the said United Provinces:&mdash;Liberty
shall also be granted to bury the subjects
of His Britannic Majesty who may die in the territories of
the said United Provinces, in their own burial places, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
in the same manner, they may freely establish and maintain.
In the like manner, the citizens of the said United
Provinces shall enjoy, within all the dominions of His Britannic
Majesty, a perfect and unrestrained liberty of conscience,
and of exercising their religion publicly or privately,
within their own dwelling-houses, or in the chapels and places
of worship appointed for that purpose, agreeably to the system
of toleration established in the dominions of his said
Majesty.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XIII.</span></h4>

<p>It shall be free for the subjects of His Britannic Majesty,
residing in the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata, to dispose
of their property, of every description, by will or
testament, as they may judge fit; and, in the event of any
British subject dying without such will or testament in the
territories of the said United Provinces, the British consul-general,
or, in his absence, his representative, shall have the
right to nominate curators to take charge of the property of
the deceased, for the benefit of his lawful heirs and creditors,
without interference, giving convenient notice thereof to the
authorities of the country; and reciprocally.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XIV.</span></h4>

<p>His Britannic Majesty being extremely desirous of totally
abolishing the slave trade, the United Provinces of Rio de
la Plata engage to co-operate with His Britannic Majesty
for the completion of so beneficent a work, and to prohibit
all persons inhabiting within the said United Provinces, or
subject to their jurisdiction, in the most effectual manner,
and by the most solemn laws, from taking any share in such
trade.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XV.</span></h4>

<p>The present treaty shall be ratified, and the ratifications
shall be exchanged in London within four months, or sooner
if possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>In witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have
signed the same, and have affixed their seals thereunto.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Done at Buenos Ayres, the second day of February, in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
and twenty-five.</p></div>

<p class="right">(Signed)&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Woodbine Parish.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Manuel Jos&eacute; Garcia.</span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;This was the first treaty entered into by any
European power with the new Republics of America;&mdash;whilst
it provided a necessary safeguard to British subjects
resorting to that part of the world, it was of great importance
to the Buenos Ayreans, not only in a political but in a
moral sense, struggling as they were, in the infancy of their
institutions, under the difficult task which they had undertaken
of attempting to constitute a Government diametrically
opposed in form and principles to the whole system of
legislation whereby the country had been ruled for three
centuries, and which, notwithstanding all their declarations
of independence, still hung like a drag-chain about their
necks:&mdash;under such circumstances every true patriot and
advocate for civilization hailed it as the best possible guarantee
of sound and liberal principles, whilst, on the other
hand, the supporters of the old Spanish laws were proportionately
discouraged, as they saw in it the death-blow to
the old colonial policy of the mother-country.</p>
